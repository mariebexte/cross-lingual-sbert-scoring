11,4_8081,4,1,"Invasive means something that invades an area. This is important in the article because the main idea is that pythons are an "" invasive"" species in the Everglades in Florida. without understanding the word invasive, one would not understand the arguements presented by Bob Roy MacInnes or skip show on the positive or negative affects of pythons as invasive species."
1013,4_9106,4,1,The word invasive has much significance in this article. The word invasive means that a species of animal is brought to a habitat it didn't originate in and is causing problems. When a species of animal is brought to a new place and breeds to the point that it's prey is becoming endangered it can have a dramatic effect on the whole ecosystem.
