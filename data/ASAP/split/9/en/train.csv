This makes it easier to sort the information, and to find a certain type of imformation faster and with greater ease."
1182,9_24134,9,2,"The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force."
1667,9_24619,9,2,"He breaks it down into different topics. The first main section,titled 'What is Space Junk?', is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris. 'Crash Course' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage."
164,9_23116,9,2,The author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter. The the author broke the article down into sections. For example in the heading 'Crash Course' it talks about the history of satellites that have collided in the past.

Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause."
1574,9_24526,9,2,The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.

Then, the author lets you know that some facts about this space junk, like how fast it travles, or how much damage it could do to a space ship. Aslo at the end they kind of leave you with a little bit of hope about the space junk by saying that maybe soace nations can work together and maybe come up with viable solution to space pollution."

Section three explains the dangers of orbiting satellites and section four explains the way scientists are trying to find solutions to the space junk problem.      Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested. Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration. It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period.      Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace. It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space. Section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to do.      In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system. I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place.

After that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites. I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' I liked this because I had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was free-floating in space. I like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held.
