2339,6_16298,6,1,"Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane.  Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  This type of diffusion requires energy.     Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell.  These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion."
