799,6_14758,6,0,One process a cell uses is called osmosis. Osmosis helps the water transport all throughout the cell and on a permeable membrane.Another process a cell uses is called active transport because substances in the cell are being transported through the membrane to the different organelles.The other process that a cell uses is called oxygen diffusion.

One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech."

983,6_14942,6,0,plasmembreane to movemovement to move around the cellplacement to place something in the cell
898,6_14857,6,1,Cells use three different methods to control movement of foreign substances. One for example would be diffusion. It controls the water that moves in and out of a cell. Another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out. They have many specialized glands/openings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell.
1005,6_14964,6,1,Cells use diffusion and osmoisis to move substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is substances moving from an area with more mass to an area with less mass. Osmoisis is the movement of water through the cell membrane. A cell membrane also has pores that particles can enter and exit from.
987,6_14946,6,1,*Osmosis - movement of water across selectively permeable cell membrane*Diffusion - molecules freely move across cell membrane until both sides have equilibruim*- transfer proteins move molecules out of the cell when there are too many
1549,6_15508,6,1,1.) Diffusion: the movement of substances from an area of higher concentration into an area of lower concentration2.)Endocytosis: process by which materials are moved into the cell3.)Exocytosis: process by wich materials are moved out of the cell.
2313,6_16272,6,1,Endocytosis moves large substances into the cell using vesicles. Exocytosis moves large substances out of the cell using vesicles. The sodium-potassium pump uses an ion channel to keep the right balance of sodium and potassium in the cell. it does this by sending potassuim into the cell and soduim out of the cell.
1473,6_15432,6,1,The cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out. The cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out. Then the last thing they can use is an enzyme. The enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly.
219,6_14178,6,1,1. Active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient.2. Simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient. This process requires no energy.3. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane. No energy is required for this process.
1897,6_15856,6,1,Semi-permiable membrane only allows substances to move across the membrane by passive and active transportation.  These let things like water go across the membrane.  With active and passive transportation the solutes will diffuse in and out of the cell to maintain their balance.  With passive transportation it does not use any energy for water to go exit and enter the cell through the processes of osmosis and diffusion.  With active transportation the water uses exocitosis and endocytosis.  All of these processes help balance out the cell and its environment to maintain homeostasis.

1329,6_15288,6,2,"Nuclear Membrane- always allows CO2 and oxygen to enter and exit, but does not allow solid objects through that do not fit through the protein channel.Passive Transport- water travels from greater to lesser with no energy being used (Osmosis)Active Transport- water travels from lesser to greater by the use of the cell's enegy"
1729,6_15688,6,2,"Passive transport-transport that requires no energy and uses transport protiensfacilitaed diffusion- type of passive transport, movement of particles from high concentration to lower concentrationactive transport- trnasport that requires enery and uses transport protiens"
347,6_14306,6,2,Osmosis- The process in which water passes through a cell membrane.Diffusion- The process in which substances other than water pass through a cell membrane.Active Transport- The process in which a cell uses ATP as a source of energy to push substances through the cell membrane.
239,6_14198,6,2,Active transport- using energy to move something across the membrane.Inactive transport- No energy needed to move a substance across the membrane.Facillitated diffusion- inactive transport that uses proteins to move a substance across the membrane.
1016,6_14975,6,3,"THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste."
526,6_14485,6,3,"One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached."
1908,6_15867,6,3,"Active transport is where the cell uses energy to pass objects across the membrane, passive transport is where there is no energy required to pass objects across the membrane, and osmosis is when water difuses across the membrane."
