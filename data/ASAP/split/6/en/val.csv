616,6_14575,6,0,"There is osmosis, homeostasis, and diffusion across a cell memebrane. Homeostasis helps control the temperature of the cells by knowing how much fluid needs to be in a cell. Osmosis is the process of how much fluid or water is needed inside of a cell. Diffusion across a cell membrane is where it only lets in certain chemicals that the body needs. It lets out the water and other fluid inside a cell."

1533,6_15492,6,0,A chain is the process used by cells to move something across the cell. The chain passes it from one to another and so on. Another way is when the phosphates that have two tails and a head keep things out of the cell. This makes the substances bounce back. Enzymes speed up the process.

2007,6_15966,6,0,there are several proesses used to stop the movement of substances across the cell surface. The first process used is the process of Liquidation. this uses the water on top of the cells movement to act as a barrier to stop things getting into the cell. Second is the cell wall. this also blocks out large substances from getting into the cell and damaging it. Lastly is defences on the inside of the cell that capture and expel bad substances from the cell

864,6_14823,6,0,One movement is passive movement. Passive movement alows substances to move freely through the cell membrane. The second movement requires an activation energy for substances to pass through. The third movement is when substances go through using proteins.
2300,6_16259,6,0,THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO USE MOVEMENT TO CONTROL CELL MEMBRANE .
1806,6_15765,6,0,"To cross the cell membrane, proteins help molecules across. Lypid heads on the outer layer and on the inner layer help to secure the cell membrane. Phosphate heads help to secure the membrane as well, to make sure nothing comes out or in that isn't suppose to."
1174,6_15133,6,0,Cells first recognize what is going to be comming through the membrane by sending a singnal to the nucleus so it then cna decide whethere or not whatever wants to enter can. Then the Golgi bodies transport whatever it is through the cell.
2082,6_16041,6,0,There are different proteins in a cell membrance.The nucleus is in the cell membrane.Eukaryotes is one of the movment substances that control the cell membrane.
1384,6_15343,6,0,There are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane.  One of them would be by only letting things go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to maintain homeostasis.  Another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell. A third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work.
2244,6_16203,6,1,Osmosis is  the transfer of water across a membrane.There are carrier proteins that transfer P and K ions across a membrane.There are special tubes that open up to the outside that only allow certain types of substances across the membrane.
1101,6_15060,6,1,"There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane."
1079,6_15038,6,1,Diffusion is where the cell moves things acrost the membrain without using energy. Active trasport is a prosses that requires energy to move things acrost the cell.
2123,6_16082,6,1,"One type of process a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion which is a type of passive transport. Another example is osmosis. This too, is a type of passive transport. A third example of a process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane is the sodium-potassium pump.  The sodium-potassium pump transfers 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell.  The sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport.  One other example is diffusion which is a type of passive transport."
911,6_14870,6,1,"Osmosis - water passing through the cell membraneCell Respiration - Cell eating, drinking, and breathing through its membrane.Cannot Remember third GO CELTICS"
477,6_14436,6,1,Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.
1856,6_15815,6,1,"Osmosis, Is the movement of water across the membrain. Endocitosis, is the movement of things in to the cell. Exocitosis, is the movement of things out of the cell."
240,6_14199,6,1,Diffusion is when a liquid is transferred across a membrane.Phagocytosis is when an object is enveloped by the membrane.
827,6_14786,6,1,Osmosis - Allows water to pass through the cell membrane.Diffusion - Allows substances to pass through membranes.RNA - trasfers information through cell membranes.
1322,6_15281,6,2,Cell mebranes are semi-permeable. They only allow certain things to enter in and out of the membrane.Proteins can be on the mebrane to guide things into the cell through active transport.Diffusion allows items to go from a high concentration area to a low concentration area through the membrane.
1583,6_15542,6,2,"Three processes used by cells to control movement across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and the electron transport chain. Active transport uses energy. Passive transport does not require energy. the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane."
375,6_14334,6,2,"One way is the tRNA moves proteins to the cytoplasm.Another way is through Active Transport, Active Transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy."
249,6_14208,6,2,One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell. Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell. in plants their cell wall controls what can get into the cell membrane by acting as a barrier from outside organisms.
946,6_14905,6,3,"Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration."
2287,6_16246,6,3,"Osmosis: The movement of water through a permeable membrane based on the concentration gradient. Water will move from higher concentration to lower concentration.Facilitated Diffussion: Like osmosis, but uses channel proteins to help guide in and out of the cell based on concentration gradient.Active Transport: Uses ATP. Concentration gradient does not dictate which way the substance can go."
1779,6_15738,6,3,Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell. Active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membrane.Passive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane.
