689,5_11656,5,0,Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus is goes through the blood stream. While in the blood stream once it gets to the other nucleus it drops off the information from the nucleus it just came from. After all that the mRNA is needed no longer. Then comes the tRNA that will help the other nucleus figure out the message. Then it helps the nucleus decode the new message to where it will make sense to the nucleus. Then the rRNA comes along. The rRNA picks up on the new decoded message. Once the rRNA is done getting the message it takes it. The last step would be to take the code and make another RNA sequence.

1291,5_12258,5,2,"The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.  There, it attaches to a ribosome.  Attatched to the ribosome, rRNA comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mRNA strand to the tRNA strand.  The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.  The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.  As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein.  When the rRNA brings a stop codon, the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell."
1469,5_12436,5,2,The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.
1091,5_12058,5,2,"After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin. The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA. Based on what three bases you have in each segment, a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid. The amino acids form an amino acid chain, which is also called a protein. After the mRNA has gone all the way through, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein."
715,5_11682,5,3,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell."
14,5_10981,5,3,"Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome.
