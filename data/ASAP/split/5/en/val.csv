1264,5_12231,5,1,During protein synthesis the mRNA first leaves the nucleus.  It then goes on to the Golgi Apparatus.  The next step is the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).  After the mRNA leaves the ER it makes its way to the nucleus.
1323,5_12290,5,2,"1) mRNA leaves nucleus through a nuclear pore2) tRNA comes carrying the complementary codon and amino         acid3) As the tRNA creates amino acids, rRNA moves along the            strand after each amino acid is complete. After a new amino        acid is created, it binds to the previous one, forming a peptide      bond4) When the tRNA encounters a stop codon, the amino acid            chain is complete"
974,5_11941,5,2,"First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein."
986,5_11953,5,2,The mRNA goes to the ribosome where the tRNA translates the mRNA's codons into peptide chains that then make a polypeptide chain that goes with others to make a protien.
1064,5_12031,5,3,"First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding."
1803,5_12770,5,3,1. The mRNA arrives in the nucleus and goes through a ribosome. 2. In the ribosome the mRNA attracts a tRNA with the anticodon that matches its codon.3. The tRNA brings the amino acid that matches the codon to the ribosome and attaches it to the other amino acids in the sequence. 4. Once the last codon is matched with its amino acid the tRNA work to form a polypeptide chain that will become a certain protein in the body based on its shape.
