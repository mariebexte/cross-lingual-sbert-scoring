232,1_233,1,0,You need limestone and marble.
207,1_208,1,0,"In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again."
464,1_465,1,0,To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
191,1_192,1,0,I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
1587,1_1588,1,0,"I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one."
14,1_15,1,0,"Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples."
1715,1_1716,1,0,You would need the nishpoping  and you would need to know were they got the number from.
338,1_339,1,0,How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
2172,1_2173,1,0,"First you would need to gather your materials. Then because safety is first, make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves. After you organize yourself, you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on. After the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph/chart."
386,1_387,1,0,The limestone have mass than all of them.
268,1_269,1,0,"I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong."

2188,1_2189,1,0,"Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is that I would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples (triple-beam balance). I would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples. The group showed the difference on their data table, but didn't list that step in their procedure. Lastly, I would need to record every different mass on the data table which also isn't a step in the group's procedure."
1188,1_1189,1,0,Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1862,1_1863,1,0,Do the experiment again but with a different solution. ^p Let the samples sit for 48 hours. ^p Instead of sit and dry. Dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth.
1258,1_1259,1,0,The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
523,1_524,1,0,Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
337,1_338,1,0,"The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment."

Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment."
1835,1_1836,1,3,"In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure. Firstly, I would need to know what types of samples to use. I can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table, but I would want to know if I had to use the same ones. Also, I would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, because my results could change if I use a different amount of vinegar than the group did. Depending on the amount of vinegar I use, the third thing I would need to know is how big the samples should be.
