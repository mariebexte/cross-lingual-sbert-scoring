Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl."
2202,1_2203,1,0,"This procedure can be improved. You must keep everything constant, including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment. Multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range. A control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate."
1825,1_1826,1,0,"The additional information is how are we suppose  to measure the mass of the object, they need a indenpent varible and I  need to then the control."
1194,1_1195,1,0,The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
166,1_167,1,0,"In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient."

428,1_429,1,0,You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
1743,1_1744,1,0,The additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out. Also I would say has with distilled water to use to use plan's ruin anything.
47,1_48,1,0,"There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar"
2048,1_2049,1,0,"A proceder that I would put in that after they all dryed, then I out them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass from starting mass."
31,1_32,1,0,You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
83,1_84,1,0,You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
1117,1_1118,1,0,Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1361,1_1362,1,0,"I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass.

410,1_411,1,0,"The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label."
829,1_830,1,1,Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
1903,1_1904,1,1,"To do replication of the experiment you would need measure how much vinegar are dropping.The other stones have already been used and cannot be used again. You also need to have a triple beam balance to be able to see how much each stone eventually weighed.Finally you would need to test them what they need to each sample for a separate 30 minutes, unless they all get different in at the same time."
1953,1_1954,1,1,"In order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid, liquid, or gas its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of item it is"
1295,1_1296,1,1,Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.

1900,1_1901,1,1,How much vinigar is in each container? What type of wood? What is the control?
811,1_812,1,1,I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
359,1_360,1,1,"After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples."
1419,1_1420,1,1,In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
2028,1_2029,1,1,They should have wrote in the 4 different sample telling us what they are. Also they told us to determine the mass but they didn't tell us to fing the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass.

449,1_450,1,1,"After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one."
1729,1_1730,1,1,I would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers. I would also add more samples to the lab. And I would repeat the lab again to see if I get the same answers.

583,1_584,1,1,"You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data."
1105,1_1106,1,1,"In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers."
662,1_663,1,1,"To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent"
901,1_902,1,1,"Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using."
890,1_891,1,1,In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
444,1_445,1,1,"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment."
278,1_279,1,1,"In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more."
1182,1_1183,1,1,"The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount."
209,1_210,1,1,"They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers."
560,1_561,1,1,In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
1846,1_1847,1,1,"The students need to be more specific. They need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups. Second, they never said what unit or never said when to record the data. Lastly they needed to state how much distilled water."
879,1_880,1,1,"To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples."
1901,1_1902,1,1,Additional information needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers. Another piece of information that is missing is how much is a sample of each material. Finally you would repeat the experiment a couple of times to see if your results change.
174,1_175,1,1,"To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment."

1712,1_1713,1,1,Some additional informatio would of bee what four examples should we whaz or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do.
995,1_996,1,1,"In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material."
1093,1_1094,1,1,"To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use.

1801,1_1802,1,1,"In order to correct the errors in this experiment, some few things need to be changed. Firstly, the procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be part of the procedure. Secondly, the procedure states, ""determine the mass."" It is not explained how to do so and what to use. Thirdly, the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with."
2001,1_2002,1,1,The three different peices of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment. The second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours. And the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them.
1229,1_1230,1,1,After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
0,1_1,1,1,"Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar."
201,1_202,1,1,"You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample."
1785,1_1786,1,1,Some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment. Another piece of information would be a graph. And lastly would be a better explanation.
793,1_794,1,1,"After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers.

1888,1_1889,1,1,. Amount of vinegar would be needed. ^p . Purpose of the experiment would be needed. ^p . Hypothesis would be needed.
2160,1_2161,1,1,"One thing that they don't say that you need to replicate the experiment would be, how much of the samples to use. The procedure dosn't say that you need to find the difference in the masses."
317,1_318,1,1,"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
78,1_79,1,1,"To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same."
635,1_636,1,1,"To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with.

2185,1_2186,1,1,I would need to know the materials that are going to get measured. The amount of time that each material stayed in the vinegar. The staring mass and the ending mass of each material.
1261,1_1262,1,1,"To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass."
1050,1_1051,1,1,I think that these braid made to for the
993,1_994,1,1,How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
1573,1_1574,1,1,First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1911,1_1912,1,1,"In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need the temperature of the vinegar. The amount of vinegar poured into each container and the amount of samples needed (how much needed."

545,1_546,1,1,"To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container."
247,1_248,1,1,"First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable."
276,1_277,1,2,"Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well."
479,1_480,1,2,In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
327,1_328,1,2,"To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups."

1495,1_1496,1,2,"In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results."

1013,1_1014,1,2,For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
889,1_890,1,2,What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
884,1_885,1,2,"To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp.

Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure."
1313,1_1314,1,2,You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
834,1_835,1,2,"In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment."
748,1_749,1,2,They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
223,1_224,1,2,Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2.

In order foreach sample to get the same treatment and be as accurate as possible you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you also would need to know how much water to rinse with. The right factor is also important. The students should be more specific about where the samples should be put, rather light or dark, because this effects the outcome."
1158,1_1159,1,2,"Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container."
531,1_532,1,2,The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
684,1_685,1,2,"After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass."
2074,1_2075,1,2,"Additional information needed, would first be what the four different samples are. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each containers.

A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4."
1501,1_1502,1,2,"After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect."
13,1_14,1,2,In order the replicate the experiment you need
2122,1_2123,1,2,"Some additional information needed to repeat this process would be how much vinegar to put in each container, if we should let the samples sit in room temperature or in hot and colder area, new to determine the mass, and how much of each sample should we place into the single container."

1844,1_1845,1,2,If I were to rewrite the procedure I would incude what the samples were. Also I would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers.
1074,1_1075,1,2,"This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers."
1770,1_1771,1,2,"In step one, the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested. It is not specific enough by just saying ""four different sample"". In step 2, the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container.

In order to be able to replicate this experiment, that must be clarified."
1253,1_1254,1,2,You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You need to know how bigof a container.
1932,1_1933,1,2,In the procedure number I doesn't explain what four different samples to use. Another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use.

804,1_805,1,3,"After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar."
1756,1_1757,1,3,"To replicate the experimenty, you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container. You would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored. In addition you would need to know what materials the samples were."
688,1_689,1,3,"To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment."

1907,1_1908,1,3,"This procedure lacks important details and is not in order. Step one is too similar to step 6. Need to specify what kind of different samples, and how to determine the beginning mass. Step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container. The procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results. Step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information. In step 6, they should include how to calculate the mass, for example subtract beginning mass from end mass. Add, record data results."
1550,1_1551,1,3,"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
