1615,2_4403,2,0,"A. Plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C stretch 1mm and plastic D didn't stretch. ^p B. The student could have done this over distinct results . The student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower."
1471,2_4259,2,0,"In trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn't a tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample A had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, while sample D had the most amount of millimeters and didn't change at all. ^p 1 Use different sample of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure they are all coming from same temperature."
1296,2_4084,2,0,"3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers."
1495,2_4283,2,0,a) Conclusion - plastic Type A stretched the least and plastic Type D the most. ^p 1. name type of plastic being used 2. what kind of weights are being used.
772,2_3560,2,0,"Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials."
426,2_3214,2,0,I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
1398,2_4186,2,0,The student should have made the procedure less.
253,2_3041,2,0,Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
693,2_3481,2,0,"The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on."
38,2_2826,2,0,Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
1341,2_4129,2,0,A= As the students where doing the right thing but they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more. ^p B=The could have improved it by writing how many times they did it and record how long they did it for.
962,2_3750,2,0,Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
841,2_3629,2,0,A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
851,2_3639,2,0,In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
1111,2_3899,2,0,A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
831,2_3619,2,0,"Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result."
688,2_3476,2,0,"In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty."
1644,2_4432,2,0,"A) Based on the students data, my conclusion to this is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, because for both trials, the mm of the length was still the same. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch."
17,2_2805,2,0,"A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used."
127,2_2915,2,0,"a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer."
1696,2_4484,2,0,"In conclusion all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type D that stoped the same length. They would of told the types of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also, give before descriptions on procedures."
613,2_3401,2,0,"B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation."
1158,2_3946,2,0,A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
300,2_3088,2,0,It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
1687,2_4475,2,0,"The polymer plastics all had different results after each trial was tested. Plastic type A and B both had an increase in length after trial 2. Plastic type C had a negative effect by going down a mm, and D stayed the same. The student could have used different time periods, or even tested the durability of the plastic after it was tested."
1233,2_4021,2,0,"The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched."
1531,2_4319,2,0,A conclusion for the graph could be what they did to get to the end of their experiment.^p B. One way the student could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing. Another way is to make sure everything is all right.
1441,2_4229,2,0,"In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer. These students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic, stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well."
746,2_3534,2,0,In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
926,2_3714,2,0,T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
1205,2_3993,2,0,"Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount."
184,2_2972,2,0,"From the students data from conclude that type D is most stretch able and that type A is the least stretchable. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5."
308,2_3096,2,0,"They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1."
1379,2_4167,2,0,"(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretched the most, so it would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Telling what kind of plastics they used were: ^p     2 Be more detailed by how long they stretched it for."
692,2_3480,2,0,The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
205,2_2993,2,0,Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
801,2_3589,2,0,My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
908,2_3696,2,0,Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
1662,2_4450,2,0,To my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than the first time because it was already stretened from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened. two ways to improve the experiment is time it longer to see the difference and use a different piece of plaste for each trial.
1270,2_4058,2,0,"b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics."
1382,2_4170,2,0,The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table.
812,2_3600,2,0,A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
1084,2_3872,2,0,"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
1117,2_3905,2,0,a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
1071,2_3859,2,0,a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
212,2_3000,2,0,The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
1243,2_4031,2,0,"In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic."
1439,2_4227,2,0,b)The first would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to understand the difference of both experiment/ second would be to conduct a longer time setting to see how long it last.
462,2_3250,2,0,"A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results."
750,2_3538,2,0,To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
543,2_3331,2,0,"In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also."
639,2_3427,2,0,"My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched."
55,2_2843,2,0,a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
1581,2_4369,2,0,The student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights.
828,2_3616,2,0,A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
231,2_3019,2,0,"Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph."
1059,2_3847,2,0,"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
483,2_3271,2,0,Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
950,2_3738,2,0,"According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm."
1448,2_4236,2,0,My conclusion about this experiment is that T1 doesn't strech more than T2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic D or change.
347,2_3135,2,0,"a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials."
601,2_3389,2,0,The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
1322,2_4110,2,0,"Based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched, one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. One way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were. And second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after."
770,2_3558,2,0,My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
1340,2_4128,2,0,a) T2 the amount that was stretched in was more than the amount in T1. ^p b) The student could have estimated 2.
1200,2_3988,2,0,"From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials."
118,2_2906,2,0,"To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic."
452,2_3240,2,0,"To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment."
227,2_3015,2,0,For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
868,2_3656,2,0,The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
1124,2_3912,2,0,The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
671,2_3459,2,0,"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
81,2_2869,2,0,"The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something."
986,2_3774,2,0,"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
373,2_3161,2,0,My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
638,2_3426,2,0,A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
321,2_3109,2,0,"Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one."
1022,2_3810,2,0,"(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment."
1347,2_4135,2,0,The plastics stretched a small amount in most in some stayed the same.^p He could of added more weights.^p Waited more times.
351,2_3139,2,0,"A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights"
1245,2_4033,2,0,"In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details."
1130,2_3918,2,0,"Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic."
845,2_3633,2,0,"(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart."
88,2_2876,2,1,2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
450,2_3238,2,1,The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
1537,2_4325,2,1,a) Based on the data type B stretched the most in both trials then any others. Type B had more elatistity and type A had the least elastisity. ^p b) This student could improve this experiment by recording the amount it stretched every 2 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in T1 is used in T2.
1289,2_4077,2,1,a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.
503,2_3291,2,1,A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
1395,2_4183,2,1,"a) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched more than plastic type A, C, & D. The purpose of this experiment was to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability. Data shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type A, but plastic B stretched more than all of the plastic types. The student could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure."
357,2_3145,2,1,"a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data."
1377,2_4165,2,1,"In the data tables there are four different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights, within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type b had the longest trail. They could have told us what type of plastic wrap they used and they should have more trials."
1538,2_4326,2,1,Based on the students data the conclusion will be that plastic B works better than the others in the first trial plastic B had 22 mm and the second trial plastic B had 23 mm.^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design are to repeat the experiment. Another way is to add a control.
499,2_3287,2,1,"A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights."
284,2_3072,2,1,"It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results."
697,2_3485,2,1,"Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials."
1281,2_4069,2,1,a. Conclusion: type a plastic stretched the most. ^p b. The student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial.
268,2_3056,2,1,"This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials."
1172,2_3960,2,1,Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
1690,2_4478,2,1,The student got different results. He got A-B lower higher and C-D higher lower. ^p Two ways he could have improved his experimental design was by doing it over.
891,2_3679,2,1,Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
237,2_3025,2,1,A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
428,2_3216,2,1,"Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs."
644,2_3432,2,1,a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
1629,2_4417,2,1,A) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that A was the weakest and C was the most ourable are ^p B) one wagt that it can be improved is to explain how C was unstretched. Another way for improvement was have more trials to see what happens to each of the plastics.
1202,2_3990,2,1,"Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct."
858,2_3646,2,1,"A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure."
291,2_3079,2,1,One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
1524,2_4312,2,1,"1) Acording to the data, plastic B stretched the most, and with the exeption of D, the second trial tests only differed by 1 or 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) To have improved the experiment, the student could have stretched the plastics longer. The second time on used heavier weights during te second trial."
54,2_2842,2,1,I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
1206,2_3994,2,1,A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
317,2_3105,2,1,"In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change."
943,2_3731,2,1,"A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics."
968,2_3756,2,1,"Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure."
1436,2_4224,2,1,a) Based on the students data plastic type D is the constant and will always be ^p 20mm but B is stretchies. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved this would have been to indentify the types of plastic and how much weight was being added.
386,2_3174,2,1,The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
1240,2_4028,2,1,a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
560,2_3348,2,1,I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
243,2_3031,2,1,"A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results."
1533,2_4321,2,1,In the trials the plastic type B stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest. b The students could have improve their experiment by running 1 more trial for validity and a control to compare to.
1053,2_3841,2,1,In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
985,2_3773,2,1,Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
593,2_3381,2,1,"My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure."
1413,2_4201,2,1,A.) That type B plastic is the strogest type of plastic they used in this investigation. It held the same while streching the most.^p B.) One way they could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import. Also they did not state how much weight.
595,2_3383,2,1,The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
1069,2_3857,2,1,"A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period."
1103,2_3891,2,1,"B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were."
696,2_3484,2,1,Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
808,2_3596,2,1,According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
182,2_2970,2,1,The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
1196,2_3984,2,1,"a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge."
261,2_3049,2,1,(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
1232,2_4020,2,1,"A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more."
429,2_3217,2,1,"A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol"
844,2_3632,2,1,"A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials."
604,2_3392,2,1,1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
506,2_3294,2,1,A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
217,2_3005,2,1,After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
588,2_3376,2,1,a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
348,2_3136,2,1,A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
598,2_3386,2,1,A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
400,2_3188,2,1,"A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic."
1418,2_4206,2,1,"a) The table doesn't tell you much about how much they exactly stretched, the students only put what I assume the end length of the marble. Nothing can really be told with this information.^p (b) They should mention the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also they should have mentioned this in the table. On the table, the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched."
1102,2_3890,2,1,In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
218,2_3006,2,1,"a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D."
1257,2_4045,2,1,"(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials."
453,2_3241,2,1,"In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags."
1635,2_4423,2,1,"A - In the second trial plastic type A and B both had more mm but plastic type C in the first trial there was more and with plastic type D it was the same  for both trials.B-They could repeat trials, and use more different type of plastics."
1426,2_4214,2,1,(1) He could of used the same amount of weight. ^p (2) Use a different conteince.
1516,2_4304,2,1,a) Plastics will stretch and bend when weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to be changed. ^p b) The students could have listed the types of plastics being used and listed the original length.
899,2_3687,2,1,Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
975,2_3763,2,1,"A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time."
183,2_2971,2,1,a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
1422,2_4210,2,1,"Based on the students data for each trial, the amount of plastic stretched, it would first rise, decreased, then rise again. ^P B.) 1.) For the experimental design, they could have explained how much do the weights weighed. ^P 2.) The student should've showed what type of plastic he used."
28,2_2816,2,1,"I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm."
1394,2_4182,2,1,"A conclusion that be drawn from the data table is that the, plastic type B had the most weights although they could have improved their experiment by. Clamping are side to a table, which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width."
22,2_2810,2,1,The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
1370,2_4158,2,1,"From the graph shown I feel that plastic type ""B"" was more durable than the other plastic because at trial 1 it was the highest mm stretched and some for trial 2. ^P B. Two ways the student could have improved the design is to do more than just 2 trials. They could've also done it in different measurements."
749,2_3537,2,1,"Repeat the procedure, and use more examples."
447,2_3235,2,1,The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
298,2_3086,2,1,"The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group."
364,2_3152,2,1,"(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control."
269,2_3057,2,1,A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
1168,2_3956,2,1,"Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing."
1342,2_4130,2,1,"In conclusion plastic type B proved to be the most strechable (after 5 mins)  reaching ti 22 $ 23 mm stretched. Howevwr plastic type A proved to be the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial and 17 mm in trial 2. Plastic type B proved to be the second least strechable and 20 mm at both trials  and type C proved to be the second least strechable. After five minutes in trial 1 it was 14mm long and in trial two it was 13 mm long, ""A"" was the least stretchable while ""B"" was the most stretchable."
1365,2_4153,2,1,"Based on the conclusion plastic type B resulted in the most stretched T1-22, T2-23. concluding that 1/4 it was the most strongest.The students should have added a specific amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type lastly the student should have performed the second trial with different measurement."
341,2_3129,2,1,Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
366,2_3154,2,1,"A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual."
1542,2_4330,2,1,b)The student could have improved by describing how many weights are used and how much they weighed.
827,2_3615,2,1,Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
754,2_3542,2,1,"Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight."
1086,2_3874,2,1,"Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase."
1021,2_3809,2,1,"To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment."
1419,2_4207,2,1,a) It is clear that plastic D is the least elastic and that plastic A is the most elastic plastic. ^p b) To improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third trial. And could have specified what the length was at each weight.
511,2_3299,2,1,A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
1223,2_4011,2,1,Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
3,2_2791,2,1,"A conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm,while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking. One way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights. A second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to."
222,2_3010,2,1,I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
1389,2_4177,2,1,The student's data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In the end the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to the experiment. Also more weighes on the plastics to have more accurate ressults.
1187,2_3975,2,1,a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
467,2_3255,2,1,a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
1484,2_4272,2,1,"The needed more trails. Also could more infomation, and the most streched ploymer was 23."
44,2_2832,2,1,a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
967,2_3755,2,1,"Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic."
1548,2_4336,2,1,The students could have averaged the two lengths of each plastic to get only one number for each. They also should have done one more trail to make it reliable.
925,2_3713,2,1,A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
586,2_3374,2,1,(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
63,2_2851,2,1,"A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic."
946,2_3734,2,1,"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results."
1388,2_4176,2,1,Plastic D it not even strectch. ^p B- include sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags.
539,2_3327,2,1,"Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic."
473,2_3261,2,1,"Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity."
216,2_3004,2,1,Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
1269,2_4057,2,1,"Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results."
0,2_2788,2,1,Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
830,2_3618,2,1,The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
819,2_3607,2,1,"plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not."
1136,2_3924,2,1,"Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one."
666,2_3454,2,1,A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
527,2_3315,2,1,"The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time."
412,2_3200,2,1,"a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics."
24,2_2812,2,1,Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
337,2_3125,2,1,"Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added."
145,2_2933,2,1,A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
1066,2_3854,2,1,A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
1554,2_4342,2,1,a) I conclude that plastic B is more strechable because it has the most (higher) length which is 23 and two trials. ^p The student could have take a longer table and do all the plastic and attached the clamp in all of them while the one before was hanging for 5 mins.
1286,2_4074,2,1,B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.
724,2_3512,2,1,"Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of."
1356,2_4144,2,1,There  wasn't much of a difference between (T1) and (T2). It only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same. One way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial. Another way the student could have improved the experiment is by using several other materials not just plastic.
705,2_3493,2,1,"based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong."
20,2_2808,2,1,"a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20."
1291,2_4079,2,1,Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.
1204,2_3992,2,1,That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
131,2_2919,2,1,"If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data."
1171,2_3959,2,1,"A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same."
141,2_2929,2,1,"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
566,2_3354,2,1,Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
436,2_3224,2,1,3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
534,2_3322,2,1,a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
1261,2_4049,2,1,"A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names."
133,2_2921,2,1,"Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights."
469,2_3257,2,1,a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
664,2_3452,2,1,"Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic."
371,2_3159,2,1,A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
660,2_3448,2,1,"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
661,2_3449,2,1,Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
947,2_3735,2,1,"1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes."
878,2_3666,2,1,"A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials."
1170,2_3958,2,1,"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
176,2_2964,2,1,a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.
1319,2_4107,2,1,I conclude that plastic type A has the most stretchability because from T1 to T2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh. Another improvent needs to be in step 5. The student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy.
368,2_3156,2,1,A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
1237,2_4025,2,1,a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
1485,2_4273,2,1,It is a good experiment with nice ideas and it shows which plastic is most flexible. The first way to improve the test is to use different brand name plastics to test the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the lab is valid.
689,2_3477,2,2,"According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time."
392,2_3180,2,2,"A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown."
959,2_3747,2,2,The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
628,2_3416,2,2,"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
1335,2_4123,2,2,"A. Based on the results of the experiment, I believe that plastic C will take the most weight. All the other plastics either extended when more weight was added or stayed the same. Plastic C though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic A which went from 10 to 12 and B which went from 22-23 mm and lastly D witch remained at 20 mm the whole duration. ^p B: A way the student could of improved the experiment validity is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length."
1405,2_4193,2,2,a) My conclusion is that plastic type  B is the most stretchable. ^p To make this experiment more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test.
332,2_3120,2,2,"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
286,2_3074,2,2,"In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk."
1493,2_4281,2,2,"According to the students data we can now conclude that plastic B is the strechiest, Streching 22mm and 23mm on the second trial. But one way the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of plastic for both trials so your not using the same one. Another way it could be improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight is being used and specify that each plastic should use the same weight."
536,2_3324,2,2,"Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals."
1640,2_4428,2,2,"a.) Based on the students data from this experiment, plastic type B had the greatest stretchability out of all four plastics. ^p To be more accurate with the validity of their results would be to make sure the length of all the samples in both trials were equal for all types. Another way to improve i he experiment would be to increase the weights in the second trial by  doubling them, and then sampling the data from the two trials."
1494,2_4282,2,2,"a. In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable out of the group of plastic because in trial 1, plastic B stretched 22mm and in trial 2, plastic B stretched 23mm. This compares to plastic A, that stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12mm on the second trial, which was the least stretchable. ^p b) The students conducting this experiment could have named specific plastics instead of saying 'take a sample of plastic'. Also, the students could have taken measurements as the 5 minutes were passing. Multiple trials would have also helped prove the validity of this investigation."
1251,2_4039,2,2,"The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting."
1612,2_4400,2,2,(a) Plastic B stretched the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic D being the second longest and A having the shortest amount stretched. ^p (B)  The student could have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just 5 minutes and they could of had a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second time round.
1116,2_3904,2,2,"a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch."
454,2_3242,2,2,"a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial."
329,2_3117,2,2,"Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used."
1666,2_4454,2,2,"The data shaved that plastic A stretched the most compared to the other plastics. Plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C decreased 1mm in trial 2 and plastic D stayed the same. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results is to include the starting length of each plastic in the results to better understand how much each plastic stretched. Secondly for trial 2 I think the student should have added more weights and added a trial 3 with more weights for more results."
1307,2_4095,2,2,a) Polymer plastic type B has the highest stretchability. It had 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. None of the other types of plastics stretched further than 20mm on either trial. ^p b) The student could have tested more types of plastic or made more trials to improve the experiment.
1344,2_4132,2,2,(a) According to the student's data plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial.^p (b). The student should have specified how much the weights weighed and how many of them to put on the clamp.^p The student should have specified what they were measuring the length of the plastic types with.
1528,2_4316,2,2,It appears that plastic type B stretched out the most and plastic type A stretched out the least. One way that the student could have improved their experiment would be to tell what kind of plastic to do. Also the student should have put how big the plastic was in the begining.
656,2_3444,2,2,A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
1336,2_4124,2,2,"I conclude that plastic type B has a stronger materials compared to the other types. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more trials, another way it would have been better is by saying how much weight was being used."
918,2_3706,2,2,"Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp."

1684,2_4472,2,2,Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic A and B are both equally stretchy. They both increased by one mm long. I can also conclude that plastic D is not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm. One way the student could have improved the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length at the beggining so the results are more valid and clear. They also could have been specific about how much weight to be added. Another thing they could add is a controll

208,2_2996,2,2,"A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch."
1072,2_3860,2,2,A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
753,2_3541,2,2,Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
1060,2_3848,2,2,"Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data.

788,2_3576,2,2,The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic.

380,2_3168,2,2,In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.

52,2_2840,2,2,"A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment."
407,2_3195,2,2,Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
576,2_3364,2,2,a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
1602,2_4390,2,2,The data that the student got is corrupted. The reason I say this is because he/she should have wrote on the data table the starting measure of each bag. He/she could have also used the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results. Another way that the student could have improved would be doing another trial to make that the results are accurate.
235,2_3023,2,2,"In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more."
45,2_2833,2,2,"Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too."
861,2_3649,2,2,"Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid."
919,2_3707,2,2,a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
1428,2_4216,2,2,"A)A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type D had the same amount stretched for trial one and two, which was 20(mm).^p (b)Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by keeping the sample piece of the type of plastics the same. Also to use the same types of weights."
1278,2_4066,2,2,Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.
283,2_3071,2,2,Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
727,2_3515,2,2,A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
413,2_3201,2,2,"a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used."
191,2_2979,2,2,"Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time."
365,2_3153,2,2,"Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact."
177,2_2965,2,2,"In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up)."
922,2_3710,2,2,"A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount."
924,2_3712,2,2,"Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure."
290,2_3078,2,2,"a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything"
230,2_3018,2,2,Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
1118,2_3906,2,2,"A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched."
1539,2_4327,2,2,A) Plastic type B was the stretchest plastic type because in trial 1 it got 22 mm and it trial 2 it got 12 mm. ^p B) The student could have had the plastic types start at the same lengths and could have changed the experiment the which plastic is the most discrible.
1390,2_4178,2,2,The students data is good the trial were coles in number. It seems that plastic type B was the streched with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trials helped the way. ^P I hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in. He said to put a weight on the end but how much.
872,2_3660,2,2,a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
1135,2_3923,2,2,A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
1211,2_3999,2,2,"a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control."
265,2_3053,2,2,One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
204,2_2992,2,2,a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
552,2_3340,2,2,"The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used."
1463,2_4251,2,2,"A) According to the students data, polymer B stretched the most. ^P B) The student should specify the exact amount of weight to be attached to the plastic. The student should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched, horizontally or vertically, because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic. For example, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom."
128,2_2916,2,2,"Based on the students data, we could see that plastic Type B was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials, they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched."
379,2_3167,2,2,"Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite."
939,2_3727,2,2,I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
790,2_3578,2,2,"a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put."
1332,2_4120,2,2,A) Based on the student data I conclude that plastic type B was the stretchiest of all plastics because in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both times which was higher for any other plastic. ^P B) The student could have improved this experiment by having a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastics and he should have had a control group.
561,2_3349,2,2,Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
887,2_3675,2,2,Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
448,2_3236,2,2,"A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer."
1087,2_3875,2,2,"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
555,2_3343,2,2,My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
1028,2_3816,2,2,a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
1511,2_4299,2,2,"a.) Based on the student's data,  plastic type B had the most stretchabilty, or was the stretchiest plastic.^p b.) The students could have used a control, for example a non plastic to compare the stretchabilty and to help make a better conclusion and analysts. The students could have used the same amount of weight for each plastic and each trial, so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their data."
1247,2_4035,2,2,"In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types."
558,2_3346,2,2,"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
982,2_3770,2,2,My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
718,2_3506,2,2,"Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not."
1381,2_4169,2,2,"What I can conclude from the groups results is that polymer B has the least amount of resistance  to stretching. I know this because, plastic type B stretched an average length of 22.5 mm, this is larger than the three other plastics. Also, plastic type A had the most resistance to stretching because it only stretched an average length of b11mm. There is two ways to add validity and impede the experimental design. One way is to add a control to the groups and second, to have specific measurements for the amount of weight being added."
1515,2_4303,2,2,"The table shows that plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastic types. Plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial one and stretched 23mm in trial two. Plastic type D stretch 20mm in both trials, them plastic type C stretched 14mm in trial one and 13mm in trial two and plastic Type A stretched 10mm in trial one and 12mm in trial two. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment design and/on validity of the results are that they could have used the exact same weights everytime and said what types pf plastic they used."
1079,2_3867,2,2,"Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials."
1632,2_4420,2,2,"Based on the students data the conclusion that plastic B has the most stretchability because it has the highest length in millimeters after the experiment. Two things the students could have done to improve the experimental design and validity of the results would be holding the variables more controll. For example set the length of each plastic next if they had a set amount of weight, the results would have come out more valid."
700,2_3488,2,2,"a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from"
1627,2_4415,2,2,"In the second trail two plastics, A and B, stretched out more unlike 2 and B, C stretched less the second time while D stayed the same. One way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing it a third time to see which of the highest two were right. A second would be showing the length of the plastics when the student first started."
94,2_2882,2,2,"Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic."
662,2_3450,2,2,A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
226,2_3014,2,2,"In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control."
1504,2_4292,2,2,"a)From this information I come to conclude plastic type B stretched the most out the four types. Plastic type D came next, then C, the A.^p (b)This student could made this lab better in two ways, they could have told us how much weight to put on the plastics, and they could have explained more how to measure it, with inches or milimeters."
653,2_3441,2,2,"Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic."
634,2_3422,2,2,"According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar."
1449,2_4237,2,2,"A conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic B has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2.5mm more than any of the other plastics. However, based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable. One way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control, for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic, to ensure that the independent variable, the plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the amount the plastic stretches."
1140,2_3928,2,2,"The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials."
463,2_3251,2,2,"a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three."
1346,2_4134,2,2,"based on the experiment data, I can conclude that plastic B has the greatest stretchability by stretching 22 & 23 mm. the least stability plastic was A of only 10 & 12mm. ^p The students could have improved the experience by adding independent/ dependent variables, and completed 3 trials all with equal weights."
999,2_3787,2,2,"A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid."
722,2_3510,2,2,"a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere."
523,2_3311,2,2,"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
624,2_3412,2,2,"A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic."
713,2_3501,2,2,"Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight."
352,2_3140,2,2,"Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were."
210,2_2998,2,2,I would conclude that the plactic T2 to more strechy than T1. It could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that.
1224,2_4012,2,2,Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
149,2_2937,2,2,"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
1631,2_4419,2,2,"In this expierement we have learned that all bags tend to stretch when carrying weights. In this expierement, plastic type A proved to be the least stretchiest while plastic type  proved to be stretched the most. ^P The students could have said how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be. ^P The students could have also said what type of plastics they used so we can test it our selves."
1465,2_4253,2,2,"In trial 2 plastic type A stretched 2more millimeters than in trial , and plastic type D did not have any change. ^p The student could have completed more trials. Also the student could have how many weights before breaking."
1339,2_4127,2,2,In conclusion it seems that the plastic type B's outcome of amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three.^p State what length you're excepting to keep them the same.^p Also for better results the students should have done a third trial to be on the safe side.
135,2_2923,2,2,You can came to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most stretchable for trial one it got 22mm and for trialz it got 25mm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got 20mm both trials.
197,2_2985,2,2,The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
1545,2_4333,2,2,"(A) Overall, plastic type B had stretched the most. Plastic type B just stretched a little further. This means that plastic type B had the most resistence to the weights/clamps and this plastic would be the most durable to use B. One way to improve the design would be to measure all the plastics to the same length so the results come out more accurate. Another way could be to have weights all be the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others."
195,2_2983,2,2,"My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic."
944,2_3732,2,2,"Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic."
1229,2_4017,2,2,"A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10."
1000,2_3788,2,2,"My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none."
1228,2_4016,2,2,"Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp."
720,2_3508,2,2,"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
1345,2_4133,2,2,The plastic type did have an effect on the amount stretched. As the plastic stretched from A to D the amount stretched in mm changed from 10 to 20 on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial. I say plastic B stretched the best becaused it stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm the first and second trials. ^P The students expirement was not valid. They could of done more trials. They could of told us what type of plastic they used.
1249,2_4037,2,2,Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
1280,2_4068,2,2,The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic was plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic.
148,2_2936,2,2,a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
1447,2_4235,2,2,"(A) Based on the data graph it is clear the polymer B is the most strecthable because in T1 it stretched 22 cm and in T2 it strectched 23cm, beating the other polymers. ^p (B) The two ways they could have bettered this project is by 1, add more trials to it and 2. They could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment."
1369,2_4157,2,2,a) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data can be that plastic type D has the most stretchability in both trials.^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics original length before the trials. (2) If they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights.
859,2_3647,2,2,"A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials."
1575,2_4363,2,2,"a) B stretched out the most because it stretched out, a total of 45(mm) A 22, C27 and D 40. B) One way to improve the lab is instead of two trials do three. Find waay is have a control grone."
270,2_3058,2,2,I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
68,2_2856,2,2,"In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be."
1068,2_3856,2,2,Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
923,2_3711,2,2,"According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results."
1082,2_3870,2,2,"Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials."
495,2_3283,2,2,a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
529,2_3317,2,2,"a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights."
535,2_3323,2,2,"A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams."
1559,2_4347,2,2,The conclusion I have drawn based on the students data is that plastics B and D are the best polymers because those were the two plastics that had stretched the farthest on both trials. ^p Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to do even more trials. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time.
142,2_2930,2,2,"a) Based on the data shown on the table, I would say that plastic type B has the most amount stretched. ^P b) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, 5mins does nothing."
475,2_3263,2,2,Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
39,2_2827,2,2,"One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic ""D"" stretched the most and plastic ""A"" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial."
451,2_3239,2,2,The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
171,2_2959,2,2,A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
1043,2_3831,2,2,A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
991,2_3779,2,2,a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
276,2_3064,2,2,Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
882,2_3670,2,2,"To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?"
80,2_2868,2,2,"Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
1492,2_4280,2,2,"As you can see, plastic type A stretched the least and type B stretched the most. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment design would be to tell whatt. They are doing with the plastic and do a third trial. The purpose of the experiment is unknown."
349,2_3137,2,2,"In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights."
113,2_2901,2,2,"a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added."
1198,2_3986,2,2,"(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length."
629,2_3417,2,2,"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
996,2_3784,2,2,"Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached."
48,2_2836,2,2,I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
1444,2_4232,2,2,a) A good conclution for this would be that type be streched the furthest. ^P b) Two ways the students could have made this better would to have tested exactly what type of plastic to use and how long each peice should be.
491,2_3279,2,2,One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
1578,2_4366,2,2,A. Based off of the data table plastic B had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic A had the least with 10mm estretch.^p B Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to have more trials and also have a control
1050,2_3838,2,2,"a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas."
821,2_3609,2,2,"a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer."
1616,2_4404,2,2,"a. As you can see, plastic B could stretch longer than any plastic. Plastic D had similar results for both trials. Plastic A was the only plastic that was able to not stretch that far.^p b. What this student should do to improve his experiment is to run more trials and to add what he is comparing to."
810,2_3598,2,2,a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
764,2_3552,2,2,"A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely."
1104,2_3892,2,2,That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
893,2_3681,2,2,Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
37,2_2825,2,2,A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
1255,2_4043,2,2,A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
876,2_3664,2,2,(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
309,2_3097,2,2,"3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials."
1337,2_4125,2,2,Plastic type B stretches the most. The students could have said how much heights they put on the plastics. They could of also mentioned the amount of time the weights were on the ruler they could of said now much tape to use.
75,2_2863,2,2,"This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed."
169,2_2957,2,2,"I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out."
1194,2_3982,2,2,"The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end."
202,2_2990,2,2,"Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb"
857,2_3645,2,2,"(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results."
121,2_2909,2,2,a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
1004,2_3792,2,2,From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
255,2_3043,2,2,Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
501,2_3289,2,2,"In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added."
1056,2_3844,2,2,Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
110,2_2898,2,2,a The conclusion is that one were smaller the another one large and in the end they both equal^p b- One way to improved is experimental design is if they change the weights. Another way to improve this experiment if they try more trail there going to be better.
114,2_2902,2,2,A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
151,2_2939,2,2,"I conclude that plastic type B would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic B is the one that stretched the farthest. In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal. The student also could have sold to use the  plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic."
306,2_3094,2,2,a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
1432,2_4220,2,2,"A) Plastic type A and B have increased in length from the first trial to the second trial. While type C have decreased and type D have remained the same length. B) Two ways would have to be ) add a certain amount of weights to hang instead of saying, in step 4, add ""weights"". Anyone who is recreating this experiment would have different amounts. And 2) add more trials, adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly."
282,2_3070,2,2,WSR
1133,2_3921,2,2,"a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes."
444,2_3232,2,2,Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
152,2_2940,2,2,(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
437,2_3225,2,2,"A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment."
70,2_2858,2,2,"According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used."
1299,2_4087,2,2,"Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most, plastic type A did the least amount of stretching. ^p They could have used more trials. They also could have added on more weight over a period of time."
1647,2_4435,2,2,The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that the amount of tape they put on the plastic was equal and how far they taped the plastic on the table.
1110,2_3898,2,2,The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
1417,2_4205,2,2,"a. Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. The student should have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was added to the clamp. Also, the student could have experimented further by also testing the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes."
1583,2_4371,2,2,Based on the students data the polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently. To better the experiment the lab needs to include the stretching measurement so there can be data to compare before & after. Another thing would to for all plastics is store on the same length. This data is neccary to make just numbers on a graph to data.
974,2_3762,2,2,a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
258,2_3046,2,2,"a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant."
1073,2_3861,2,2,"A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results."
1226,2_4014,2,2,"A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic."
885,2_3673,2,2,Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
443,2_3231,2,2,Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
158,2_2946,2,3,"The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest."
266,2_3054,2,3,"A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics."
1496,2_4284,2,3,"Based on the students data, plastic type B was the most flexible plastic A streches the least with an average growth of 11mm while in comparison, plastic B had an average strech of 22.5mm. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experiment design and be the validity of the experiment are, specify the a from of weight used and on another trial with heavier weights. This will further parsue the plan and make sure all data accurate. Another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiment is to start out with the same amount of each platic, instead of measuring different lengths to start with."
488,2_3276,2,3,Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
1312,2_4100,2,3,"The group can conclude that plastic type B, is the most effective type of plastic. According to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results. Along with that being said, the group also should have measured the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results."
993,2_3781,2,3,"a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly."
397,2_3185,2,3,a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
900,2_3688,2,3,"Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics."
1598,2_4386,2,3,"Based on the students data, Plastic Type B stretched the most. In the first trial it stretched 22 mm and in the second trail it stretched 23 mm. The second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm. The student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. Also, he/she could have stated how much weight they were using to stretch the material."
1160,2_3948,2,3,Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
715,2_3503,2,3,"a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials."
936,2_3724,2,3,A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
521,2_3309,2,3,I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
717,2_3505,2,3,(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
1585,2_4373,2,3,A) Based on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type B stretched out the most compared to all the other plastic types in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials which would of made the experiment more accurate another way would be specifying how much the weight and clamp actually weighed.
659,2_3447,2,3,A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
238,2_3026,2,3,"Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate."
293,2_3081,2,3,"According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible."
607,2_3395,2,3,"Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length."
455,2_3243,2,3,"a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time."
1667,2_4455,2,3,"Based on the student's data I can see that plastic type B had the Most stretchability because both trials it stretched the most. To make this more valid, the student should have used the same length to start with for each plastic. Also they should include how many weights should be added and have much each weight weighs in order to keep it constant."
372,2_3160,2,3,"a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples."
729,2_3517,2,3,"a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity."
1371,2_4159,2,3,"A. I could conclude from this students experiment that plastic B, was the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table."
614,2_3402,2,3,"a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid."
93,2_2881,2,3,Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
1189,2_3977,2,3,"a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic."
1671,2_4459,2,3,3.a) They found that plastic type B has the exact stretchability because it stretched more than any of the other polymers. ^p b) The could improve the validity of the experiment by doing more trials. They could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment.
331,2_3119,2,3,"a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used."
1062,2_3850,2,3,Nor.
756,2_3544,2,3,"a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights."
994,2_3782,2,3,1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
1266,2_4054,2,3,"Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others."
1100,2_3888,2,3,"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
305,2_3093,2,3,"A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic."
1567,2_4355,2,3,"Based upon the student's information "" by performing this experiment, plastic type B has stretched the most on average by 22.5 millimeters. Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting. The student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type, all of which should have the same amount."
1657,2_4445,2,3,"a) The conclusion I'd draw from the student's data would be that plastic type ""B"" was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve his experimental design, the student could've specified how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know. To improve his results validity, he could have done more than 2 trials-the more trials he did, the more valid his results would be."
557,2_3345,2,3,"A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from."
626,2_3414,2,3,"In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down."
965,2_3753,2,3,"a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment."
1505,2_4293,2,3,"A) In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability with an average of 22.5 mm stretch, followed by plastic type D, averaging 20 mm, then plastic type C, averaging 13.5 mm, then the plastic with the lowest stretchability was plastic type A, averaging 11 mm of stretch. ^P B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by including that all the plastic types were equally cut and measure. They could have also included to use the same amount of weights for each trial or experiment."
408,2_3196,2,3,NSR
1476,2_4264,2,3,"Based on the students data, polymer plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because the millimeters stretched on B trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length. (control)"
415,2_3203,2,3,"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
783,2_3571,2,3,The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
883,2_3671,2,3,"Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding."
318,2_3106,2,3,"a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics."
916,2_3704,2,3,"a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight."
1506,2_4294,2,3,In conclusion the graph shown states that plastic (type B) streched the most compared to the rest of the types of plastic. ^P One way the student can improve this experiment would he to use the same weights for each type of plastic. Another way would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial.
288,2_3076,2,3,"a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched."
346,2_3134,2,3,"Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this"
388,2_3176,2,3,"a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add."
389,2_3177,2,3,"Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial."
610,2_3398,2,3,"Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces."
960,2_3748,2,3,A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
549,2_3337,2,3,"a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed."
1287,2_4075,2,3,"I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment."
1474,2_4262,2,3,"a) After recording the data, it is obvious that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit. Another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched."
1443,2_4231,2,3,"a) You can't really draw a conclusion because, the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) They could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be."
530,2_3318,2,3,"Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable."
479,2_3267,2,3,"a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy."
260,2_3048,2,3,a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
1325,2_4113,2,3,"A) Plastic B has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic I have tested. The least stretched plastic is plastic type A which was at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretched to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C was at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D was at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability. B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. Another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area."
334,2_3122,2,3,A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
1279,2_4067,2,3,A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.
1577,2_4365,2,3,"A) I can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the most. It stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.^p B) One way this experiment could be improved is by adding more trials. Another way that this experiment could,by improved is by telling or starting how long was each plastic type before stretching it."
1558,2_4346,2,3,"A) When we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights, the results read that plastic B increased the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p B) One way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics. Another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment."
1451,2_4239,2,3,"(a) The conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretched to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It was stretched 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improve the validity of the data, the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weights added to the clamp, keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results."
862,2_3650,2,3,(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
1464,2_4252,2,3,A. In conclusion plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could've improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed.
239,2_3027,2,3,According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
1192,2_3980,2,3,a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
32,2_2820,2,3,Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
1049,2_3837,2,3,"plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic."
23,2_2811,2,3,"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
998,2_3786,2,3,A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.

To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results."
1267,2_4055,2,3,"A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability.

Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid."
1462,2_4250,2,3,"a) According to the data, plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C was the second strongest, followed by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial."
327,2_3115,2,3,"I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same.

668,2_3456,2,3,Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
1065,2_3853,2,3,Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
1386,2_4174,2,3,"Based on the data, we can conclude that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One way the student could have improved this experiment, would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control."
376,2_3164,2,3,"The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table."

1603,2_4391,2,3,In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.

B) One way the students could have improved their experiment was they could have done more trials with the different types of plastic. Another way they could have improved was to show how many weights they used and what kind of plastic they used so we could see the effect they had according to the type.
1098,2_3886,2,3,"Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability.

625,2_3413,2,3,"a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights."
1020,2_3808,2,3,"Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results."
739,2_3527,2,3,"Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process."
9,2_2797,2,3,a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
267,2_3055,2,3,"(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to."
1258,2_4046,2,3,"a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted."
980,2_3768,2,3,I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
546,2_3334,2,3,"Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched"
1234,2_4022,2,3,(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
65,2_2853,2,3,The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
459,2_3247,2,3,"a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes."
1271,2_4059,2,3,Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
1604,2_4392,2,3,"a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid."
1006,2_3794,2,3,"a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment."
619,2_3407,2,3,"According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic."
117,2_2905,2,3,"A0 I conclude that plastic type ""B"" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic ""A"" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."
19,2_2807,2,3,"As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen."
564,2_3352,2,3,"The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show."
1212,2_4000,2,3,"Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics."
494,2_3282,2,3,"(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials."
551,2_3339,2,3,In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
252,2_3040,2,3,a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
1088,2_3876,2,3,Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
1,2_2789,2,3,"Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table."
654,2_3442,2,3,"Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified."
901,2_3689,2,3,Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
516,2_3304,2,3,"Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results."
711,2_3499,2,3,"My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with."
1305,2_4093,2,3,"a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretched the least, making it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results. 2. The student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic."
568,2_3356,2,3,a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
425,2_3213,2,3,"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
26,2_2814,2,3,"a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant."
370,2_3158,2,3,I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
209,2_2997,2,3,"In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp."
1148,2_3936,2,3,"Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table."
1619,2_4407,2,3,"a) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most flexible and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initially be. This will improve validity as well."
1582,2_4370,2,3,"a) One conclusion that I determined according to the data was that plastic type B stretched the most overall in both trial 1 and 2. Another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type D, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. ^p b) One way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag."
748,2_3536,2,3,Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
1423,2_4211,2,3,"a) Plastic type B  is the plastic that stretched the most, plastic A was the one that stretched the least.^p b) The students can improve the experiment by adding another trial. Also we could have mentioned how much weight he put on the clamp."
1334,2_4122,2,3,Freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type B stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity. They could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant. Also they could add more trials to increase the validity.
647,2_3435,2,3,Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
192,2_2980,2,3,"a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,"
1446,2_4234,2,3,The strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials. The weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials.  So two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps.
201,2_2989,2,3,Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
573,2_3361,2,3,"Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is"
474,2_3262,2,3,a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
563,2_3351,2,3,"Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid."
906,2_3694,2,3,"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
193,2_2981,2,3,"The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights."
517,2_3305,2,3,"a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used."
1038,2_3826,2,3,"Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly."
402,2_3190,2,3,"3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials."
672,2_3460,2,3,A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
1638,2_4426,2,3,"A) Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh (4). Another way is to set a specific length pf plastic, not just any measure the length (1)."
1033,2_3821,2,3,"Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice."
1174,2_3962,2,3,A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
1571,2_4359,2,3,"3. a) According to the results, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These are ways the student could have made their experiment better.1) Take all plastic samples with the same length. 2) Add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial."
234,2_3022,2,3,A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
920,2_3708,2,3,Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
399,2_3187,2,3,A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
