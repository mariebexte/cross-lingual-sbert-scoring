36,2_2824,2,0,In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
1151,2_3939,2,0,b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
105,2_2893,2,0,Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
1697,2_4485,2,0,"Plastic type 'A' and 'B' stretched more in the second trial as compared to 'C' which decreased by 1mm and 'D' which stayed the same. ^p (B) Maybe to show some difference the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times."
1096,2_3884,2,0,"They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better."
1138,2_3926,2,0,Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
591,2_3379,2,0,I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
1154,2_3942,2,0,"A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better."
799,2_3587,2,0,Trial D has better performed better.
824,2_3612,2,0,(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
1526,2_4314,2,0,"To end our experiment we calculated our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 was 20 and T2 20. The students could of used less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes."
1384,2_4172,2,0,What kind of plastic was it.
496,2_3284,2,0,"a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time."
1254,2_4042,2,0,The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
1119,2_3907,2,1,"Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference."
797,2_3585,2,1,"A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results."
621,2_3409,2,1,"Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes."
1248,2_4036,2,1,"Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out."
143,2_2931,2,1,A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
343,2_3131,2,1,Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
153,2_2941,2,1,a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
775,2_3563,2,1,A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
1534,2_4322,2,1,"A) For the most part all of the plastics changed in some way except for one type. ^p B) The student could have done the experiment more then just two times, to see how his/her answers might have verifed."
699,2_3487,2,1,One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
978,2_3766,2,1,A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
486,2_3274,2,1,Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
1437,2_4225,2,1,"In conclusion,the data shows that plastic. Type B has the best stretchability in this experiment. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used for the experiment. He could have listed the materials be used in the experiment."
1164,2_3952,2,1,The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
766,2_3554,2,1,a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
1468,2_4256,2,1,Plastic B is the easiliest streached plastic. ^p They could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight. They could have tested more samples.
87,2_2875,2,1,One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
849,2_3637,2,1,a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
706,2_3494,2,1,The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
1282,2_4070,2,1,a) Plastic type A and B stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stayed the same.^p b) The student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight. Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.
1414,2_4202,2,1,3A) I would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment. They are all very close in the amount stretched when they are all the same plastic typed from T1 to T2. ^p 3b) And two way that a student could have improved the experiment was maybe having a T3 to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps till it broke to really see how much it stretched.
262,2_3050,2,1,"After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity."
1218,2_4006,2,1,A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
279,2_3067,2,1,"I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time."
984,2_3772,2,1,Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
969,2_3757,2,2,"Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types."
513,2_3301,2,2,A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
1568,2_4356,2,2,a) The conclusion based from the student data would be the more weights added to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to stretch. ^p b) The student could improve the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights weigh. Another improvement would be to do more trials.
430,2_3218,2,2,Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
391,2_3179,2,2,"A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min."
1479,2_4267,2,2,"I can conclude that plastic B streatchs out the most and plastic A streachs out the least. I know this because plastic B streatches 22 to 23, and plastic A streachs 10-12. Two was to improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic, and to add four more trials."
533,2_3321,2,2,The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
1557,2_4345,2,2,2) I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most amount out of all the other plastics. ^P b) The students could improve the experimental design by adding more trials and adding a control.
667,2_3455,2,2,"During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment."
1142,2_3930,2,2,The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
1438,2_4226,2,2,"A. To conclude, based on the data plastic type B has the most stretchability. Plastic type B was able to stretch 22 and 23mm while the closest streched (plastic type A) stretched 20 and 20.^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by telling a specific amount of weight and by being specific on what type of plastics they are using."
1042,2_3830,2,2,"a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)"
442,2_3230,2,2,"According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables."
1421,2_4209,2,2,"A. The conclusion that I drew is plastic type ""B"" was the best plastic for stretchability"". ^P B. One way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much weight to add to the clamp. The results won't be as valid if one person adds a different amount of weight than another. ^P Another way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be taped to the table."
297,2_3085,2,2,It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
256,2_3044,2,2,A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
1183,2_3971,2,2,A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
665,2_3453,2,2,"a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in."
1353,2_4141,2,2,The conclusion that was made is that plastic type B stretched more in both trials compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic Type got 22 and 23 mm for both trials while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials. The student must include in the procedure the amount of weight to add for step 4. Also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do?
1067,2_3855,2,2,We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
1184,2_3972,2,2,a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
510,2_3298,2,2,"a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements."
988,2_3776,2,2,The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
1031,2_3819,2,2,"A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did."
1678,2_4466,2,2,"A) Based on the data we found is that plastic B was the plastic that had stretched the most and plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the student could have improved there experimental design is to be more exact on the amount of weight used, Alsocould of shortend the time."
579,2_3367,2,2,"(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant."
1701,2_4489,2,2,"(A) Plastic type B stretched longer than type A, C, and D plastics. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to add make we4ight to the second trial and have tie plastic hang longer."
1010,2_3798,2,2,Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
1561,2_4349,2,2,Plastic B is the strongest with the length of 23. One why the student could improve their results is how much the weights weigh. Another way is how heavy was the clamp.
1181,2_3969,2,2,"a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3."
1352,2_4140,2,2,"a) Based on the student's data. Plastic type D was the one that stretched the most making it the most durable. For example, plastic A only stretched 10mm, while D stretched to 20mm. Also, the second trial was important because for plastic A.C, different amounts of length was recorded.^p b) One way to improve the experiment design is to tell how many weights are added to the clamps and how heavy they are. The students can then use these weights to test another trial which would make the design better. Because plastic D stretched the same amount in both trials, it'll be best to create a third trial for each plastic."
1078,2_3866,2,2,"A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials."
1132,2_3920,2,2,A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
263,2_3051,2,2,The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
275,2_3063,2,2,Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
433,2_3221,2,2,"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
1361,2_4149,2,3,"Plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights. ^p The student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant. They also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Both of these would help improve the validity of the data."
383,2_3171,2,3,"Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial."
492,2_3280,2,3,"Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results."
823,2_3611,2,3,"Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials."
198,2_2986,2,3,"The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic."
274,2_3062,2,3,"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
701,2_3489,2,3,Plastic
1440,2_4228,2,3,"a) Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B has the highest stretchability i.e lasticity. This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only "" measuring the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, making the results more valid."
1590,2_4378,2,3,"Upon the completion of the experiment, it was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic B stretched on aver age 22 mm, while Plastic A stretched an average 11mm, plastic C stretched an average 13.5 mm, and plastic D stretched an average 20mm. Two ways that the group could have improved their experiment would be to include how big the clamp is and to include how much weight is being added to the clamp."
708,2_3496,2,3,a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
362,2_3150,2,3,A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
1649,2_4437,2,3,This experiment concluded that plastic type A is the least stretchable land plastic type B the most stretchable. Plastic C is also not that stretchable and D is stretchable. One way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the weights are the same weight. Also that the original plastics are all the same length.
871,2_3659,2,3,"A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results."
196,2_2984,2,3,"A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way."
1173,2_3961,2,3,"According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces."
1216,2_4004,2,3,"a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample."
155,2_2943,2,3,"A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add."
299,2_3087,2,3,"a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer."
1210,2_3998,2,3,"A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results."
313,2_3101,2,3,a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
1488,2_4276,2,3,"The student's data clearly shows tat plastic B has the most stretchability. In that one it stretching to 22 mm, and in trial two it stretched to 23. Plastic D was a close second with 20 mm for  both trials. Plastic C stretched 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second. Finally plastic A stretched the least. It is obvious that plastic B was the stretchiest in Comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second. To improve the experimental design of the students could make sure the pieces of plastic are the same length also they could use the same clamp and weights to ensure that the weigths added"
301,2_3089,2,3,"It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy."
1461,2_4249,2,3,a) If plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic B will stretch the farthest. This is supported by the data because in T1 and T2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data.They also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment.
281,2_3069,2,3,"A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results."
417,2_3205,2,3,a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
