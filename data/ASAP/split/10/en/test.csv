418,10_26367,10,2,"white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids."
76,10_26025,10,2,light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
1434,10_27383,10,2,"white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white."
2072,10_28021,10,2,white :: having white paint would make the dog house c older so in the summer the dog would not be hot. The average for white is the coolest tempature (42(DEG))
1612,10_27561,10,2,"white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather."
445,10_26394,10,2,light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
1332,10_27281,10,2,black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
1318,10_27267,10,2,"white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid."
1815,10_27764,10,2,"black ::  If you were to chose black as your paint colo r, it woul warmer than the dark gray, light gray and white. In this expe riment black got about 53(DEG)C and the white got 42(DEG)C."
1619,10_27568,10,2,light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
330,10_26279,10,2,white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
313,10_26262,10,2,"white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest."
1208,10_27157,10,2,"black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs"
356,10_26305,10,2,"white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse"
531,10_26480,10,2,"black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog."
40,10_25989,10,2,"black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color."
1797,10_27746,10,2,"black ::  if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment, the darker the color, the mo re hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy."
146,10_26095,10,2,"black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in ""Hot Lamp"" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object."
576,10_26525,10,2,white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
362,10_26311,10,2,dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
1441,10_27390,10,2,"white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)"
1533,10_27482,10,2,"white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer."
2158,10_28107,10,2,"white :: I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial , 54(DEG)C, then for the last trial also 54(DEG)C. Where as White at its first trial got 42(DEG)C and 41(DEG)C for its last trial"
453,10_26402,10,2,dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
2167,10_28116,10,2,"white ::  The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid was the co olest out of all four lids."
1694,10_27643,10,2,light gray :: the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot. i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
1046,10_26995,10,2,"white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius"
1938,10_27887,10,2,white :: White will keep the dog house cooler inside b ecause its the lightest (brightest) color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black (darkest color) was 53 de grees C and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees C. Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house.
203,10_26152,10,2,"light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold."
1964,10_27913,10,2,"light gray :: This color was the in between color, or middl e color. It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance, so for trial 1 it was 44(DEG)c for trial 2 it was 45(DEG)c, for 3 it w as 46(DEG)C and for trial 4 it was back to 45(DEG)C. This is the best c olor, since it will keep the dog warm, but not too warm and not to cold e ither."
1136,10_27085,10,2,white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
1607,10_27556,10,2,"dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse."
913,10_26862,10,2,light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
1830,10_27779,10,2,white ::  White reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors. It also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids. This would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside.
2001,10_27950,10,2,black :: brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause blac k will absorb the sun most. accordding to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because blac k got an average of 53(DEG) and white got an average of 42(DEG). so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside.
1488,10_27437,10,2,white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
