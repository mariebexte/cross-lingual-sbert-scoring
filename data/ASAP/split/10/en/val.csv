1790,10_27739,10,1,"white ::  Since the color white's average was 42(DEG)C (the coolest temperature), it would be the best choice. Since white doesn't get as much heat, the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse."
1188,10_27137,10,1,"white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter."
1767,10_27716,10,1,black :: It will be warmer for the dog
966,10_26915,10,1,white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.

843,10_26792,10,1,"dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well."
1591,10_27540,10,1,white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
1302,10_27251,10,1,white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
1819,10_27768,10,1,"light gray ::  This color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny, but it will also create heat when it is cold."
329,10_26278,10,1,"light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside."
18,10_25967,10,1,light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
1293,10_27242,10,1,light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
93,10_26042,10,1,white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
390,10_26339,10,1,black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
639,10_26588,10,1,black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
1656,10_27605,10,1,dark gray :: Its Would Be About An Average Temperature. It s Not 2 Hot Or 2 Cold.
1310,10_27259,10,1,"light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated."
1632,10_27581,10,1,"black :: The color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy, making it a warmer place for the dog."
2002,10_27951,10,1,"white :: The lighter the color, the less heat that col or will attract/absorb"
757,10_26706,10,1,"black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off."
198,10_26147,10,1,"white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er."
1237,10_27186,10,1,light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
1821,10_27770,10,1,dark gray :: because it wasint the hotest or coldest tempi ture so it wouldent be to hot or cold in the dog house it had steady resu lts
1570,10_27519,10,1,white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
1263,10_27212,10,1,light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
974,10_26923,10,1,"white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it....."
33,10_25982,10,1,white ::  It will make the dog house cooler
1429,10_27378,10,2,white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
1236,10_27185,10,2,"black ::  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in, with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat. in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11(DEG) higher than when the jar had the white lid, this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat."
910,10_26859,10,2,"white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside."
1295,10_27244,10,2,"white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day."
1604,10_27553,10,2,white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
212,10_26161,10,2,"light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse."
1421,10_27370,10,2,"white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42."
244,10_26193,10,2,black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
228,10_26177,10,2,white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
315,10_26264,10,2,white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
537,10_26486,10,2,black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
580,10_26529,10,2,white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
1837,10_27786,10,2,"white ::  I chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog. Acording to the data table shown, it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors."
444,10_26393,10,2,"white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference."
2116,10_28065,10,2,black :: A black dog house will hold heat better than anyother color.I know this because in the lid experiment black's air temp ature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white.
1350,10_27299,10,2,white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.

2159,10_28108,10,2,"light gray ::  Since the doghouse will have a living being in it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog. 53(DEG) C is very, very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especially on a warm su mmer day. But, 41(DEG) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. So, 45(DEG) C would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog."
1563,10_27512,10,2,"light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature.

1364,10_27313,10,2,dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
1032,10_26981,10,2,white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
1498,10_27447,10,2,white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
369,10_26318,10,2,white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
752,10_26701,10,2,"white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside. Because in the experimen t, the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used, so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse."

371,10_26320,10,2,"white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer."
393,10_26342,10,2,white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
1151,10_27100,10,2,"black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it."
1522,10_27471,10,2,"black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat."
2027,10_27976,10,2,black :: The black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint. The average temperature o f the glass jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the blac k paint was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid.
1870,10_27819,10,2,"light gray :: the color of the paint on the doghouse will a ffect it in many ways. to begin with, it will change the temperature of t he doghouse. if the doghouse were black, then it would absorb alot of the energy radiating from the sun. because darker colors hold heat more. the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. making the temp erature cooler then if it were painted darker. the dark grey is going to keep it warm, but not as hot as the black paint would. and the light grey would keep it cooler, but not as cool as the white would. so it would al l depend on were you lived. and what temperature best suited your pet. th e darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat. and the lighter col ors are going to reflect more of it off. i would choose light grey for my doghouse though. because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white."
735,10_26684,10,2,black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
852,10_26801,10,2,"black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors.

261,10_26210,10,2,"light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house."
