Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.)

407,10_26356,10,2,black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
1515,10_27464,10,2,"white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat."
320,10_26269,10,2,white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot. This is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
1573,10_27522,10,2,"white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white."
788,10_26737,10,2,dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
1666,10_27615,10,2,"white :: The color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors obsorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53(DEG)c and the white lid averaged a 42(DEG)c, wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature."
1794,10_27743,10,2,white :: white is the best choice of color because the average temputre was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the d og house would be cooler with white pant

However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice."
1842,10_27791,10,2,"white ::  I chose white becuase it's the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur, so then they can escape the sun in a shady, cool dog house.There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees C and white whos highest was 43. In the winter they will have a big fur coat , so they won't need it warm inside their dog house, plus there isn't as much sun. If its too cold they can go inside the house."
