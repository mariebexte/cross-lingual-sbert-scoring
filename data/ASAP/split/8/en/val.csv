The next day, he went to Mr. Leonard with this information about him being a freshman who won the 400 hurdles and setting records.  Mr. Leonard confirmed but Paul wanted to know why he didn't it anymore.  Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he was a good athlete but he didn't have really good grades so he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college.  Paul responds saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time for your training.'"

677,8_20630,8,0,"The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul."
456,8_20409,8,0,all he wanted was to get in the big leads
1251,8_21204,8,0,I think the effect on Paul is huge. Considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles' in his life.

649,8_20602,8,0,"Mr. Leonard was a tough, stick to the rules kind of man and this made Paul obey him. Paul would never question Mr. Leonard or make rude comments because Mr. Leonard was too stern.

Also, Paul had known Mr. Leonard since he started middle school."

1538,8_21491,8,0,"The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read. It shows Paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish. Also, it shows Paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability, and you can do anything if you set your mind to it."

1660,8_21613,8,0,It seems Mr. Leonard and Paul have some history. Also it seems that Paul has hard time fitting in. Mr. Leonard seems to be tougher on Paul than anyone else. Not just physically but mentally as well. Paul and Mr. Leonard seems to come to a compromise or solution to their oh deal.
2283,8_22236,8,0,Mr. Leonard did not know how to read so dropped out of colledge.
32,8_19985,8,0,He was kind of a good kid gones bad.

441,8_20394,8,1,The emotions of Mr. Leonard was really familiar to Paul. He knew them very well they where almost like the ones he is having right now. This really touched him and it gave him the courage to keep pushing. But more than that it gave him the courage to help Mr. Leonard.
819,8_20772,8,1,The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.
2378,8_22331,8,1,The background information about Mr. Leonard seems to help Paul to try harder to strive for excellence.  He is first a little suspicious when he is stopped and asked where he is going and why he is going to the Learning center.  He soon starts to be coached by Mr. Leondard and forms a better relationship with him.  Paul grew really suspicious when Mr. Leonard asked Paul his name even though he checked Paul's hall pass twice a week.  Then the track coach told him to do a search for Grabowski on the internet.

1136,8_21089,8,1,"The effect that the background information on Mr. Lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him. Paul finds out that Mr. Lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has. But he still was an exellent runner, making Paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way. It was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades. That would make Paul want to work harder at his school work, so that the same thing would not happen to him."
305,8_20258,8,1,Now that he understand what Mr Leonard has been through he can have something to run for and he now has a new friend. he now feels as if they share a connection between one another and that he can trust in Mr. Leonard. h shows this by doing what is told and asked of him by Mr. Leonard

1346,8_21299,8,1,When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read. He finds that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar. They both felt embarrassment and Mr. Leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles.
1470,8_21423,8,1,"Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul."

Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did."
1351,8_21304,8,1,It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.

Paul had also found out the Mr. Grabowski had been in college and Paul was inspired to go to college just as he had."
1728,8_21681,8,1,That Mr. Leonard was just like Paul when he was young.
1016,8_20969,8,1,"The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard."

1900,8_21853,8,2,"The student said when he heard mr.leonard talking all that stuff sounded so familar because thats exactly how the kid was not the smatest and had to get extra help. and was easily embarassed in class but no always knowing the right answer, but the student said he had told Mr. Leonard to come on and start his training. So they were both able to help each other out."
2039,8_21992,8,2,"Paul understands why Mr. Leonard tells Paul to keep up the good work at the Learning Center.  Because Mr. Leonard was just like Paul when he was a kid, but back then they didnt really have the help Paul has now in helping him read."
857,8_20810,8,2,"He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life."
1732,8_21685,8,2,"paul i surprised at the information, he didnt know that he had been training with a track star. and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before."
371,8_20324,8,2,When he finds out that paul was a a college hurdler he was impress that he won the 400 and is kind of curious why he quit and then he tells him that he couldnt read.
1352,8_21305,8,2,Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
809,8_20762,8,2,"As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read."
911,8_20864,8,2,An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
526,8_20479,8,2,"In my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because Mr. Leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem. For the kind and friendly training Mr. Leonard did, Paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read."
2199,8_22152,8,2,"Paul goes to the website that the teacher gives him and searches Mr. Leonard, just as he is told. When he finds out the he was a star track athlete in college, he starts to get really encouraged and understands more. But when he goes to Mr. Leonard and asks why he never told him about it he is kidna embarrassed about it, becasue he flunked out of college cause he could not read just like Paul could not. And that made Paul work even harder and be more encouraged to do it."
2029,8_21982,8,2,"The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul because he connects him to Mr.Leonard.By learning that Mr. Leonard is unable to read just like himself, Paul feels a connection and feels like Mr. Leonard gets him. Also, by learning that Mr. Leonard can't read Paul feels he can relate to him and respect him more because Mr. Leonard knows what it feels like fore Paul. When Mr. Leonard talks about college and how he had to drop out because there were no tutors to help him, Paul then feels lucky that he has a place,Learning Center where he has someone to help him learn to read."
2025,8_21978,8,2,The background information given about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel several emotions.  He was excited to learn that Mr. Leonard was an excelant hurdler who broke many records and got a college scholarship.  He is also saddened and humbled that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college.  We no this from paragraph 45 where Paul talks of how he relates to Mr. Leonard and knows what it is like to no be able to read.
1574,8_21527,8,2,"Paul didn't know how to speak to Mr.Leonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college. Paul also wanted to help Mr.Leonard because he helped Paul with all of his ability that he has now, and Paul is more outgoing. Paul got asked by the high school track coach to come and be on his team. That's how Paul got the information on Mr. Leonard, and wants to try and help him to be out of his comfort zone. Paul was effected by it because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an great track star, and he just wanted to help him like he did Paul."
212,8_20165,8,2,Well Paul dose not know how to read that good. And when he gets on the URL and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read. Paul knows how that feels. And then he gose and showes him how to read.
1482,8_21435,8,2,In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
1500,8_21453,8,2,"The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school."
395,8_20348,8,2,"Mr. Leonard past effects Paul, since Mr. Leoanrd had spent his own time helping Paul with track. Paul is motivated to help Mr. Leonard after learning about his misfortune in college academics, but his superior skill running hurdels. Since Paul recieves help for reading skills he wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since that kept him from being a great track runner."
0,8_19953,8,2,"Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read. 'No school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'"
2202,8_22155,8,2,"The background information that Paul has on Mr. Leonard is that Mr. Leonard is like Paul, because they have trouble reading. When Paul finds out out the information about Mr. Leonard he is dissapointed that he fluncked out of college and that he was good at jumping hurdles. Mr. Leonard got a scholarship from a college to jump hurdles in there track team, but the work was hard that he flunked out."
1953,8_21906,8,2,Mr. Leonard's story effects Paul because Paul is a poor reader himself and just found out that a teacher couldnt stay in college because he couldnt read either and realizes that without the learning center he could have ended up just like Mr. Leonard. It teaches him to be grateful for what he has.
1974,8_21927,8,2,"The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard effects the way he looks at his mentor. Mr. Leonard has taught Paul how to hurdle for awhile now. Paul cannot read, so Mr. Leonard is trying to make Paul feel better about himself through an athletic accomplishment. Paul goes to the high school coach, who gives him a website which has information about Mr. Leonard that Paul has never seen before. He discovers on this website that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler, a track and field star. When Paul confronts him about it, Mr. Leonard says he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul does not lose any admiration for his mentor, however; he instead emphathizes with Mr. Leonard and begins to teach him to read. The information helped Paul further understand his friend."
95,8_20048,8,2,"The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard made Paul want to try harder to read. Paul knew that he was good at track but not good at school. When he found out that Mr. Leonard was the same way but then got kicked out of track for not being able to read, it made Paul only want to try harder."
493,8_20446,8,2,"The effect, on Paul, about discovering the background information on Mr. Leonard is empathy. Paul understands exactly how Mr. Leonard feels, 'embarrassed.' Paul feels led, that sinse his coach had taken such an interest in him and took time to help him overcome his obstacles, that he should return the favor and help excel Mr. Leonard with his disability."
1235,8_21188,8,2,"Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at."
479,8_20432,8,2,"The background information on Mr. Leonard helps him relate to Paul. In the story, Paul goes to the learning center to learn how to read better, and later Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard cannot read too well either. This brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard is helping him with track, Paul figures that he can return the favor by helping him with the tutoring he never got. This shows how grateful Paul is."
2140,8_22093,8,2,The information he egt inspires him to teach Mr. Leonard to read just as he tought him to do hurdles.

715,8_20668,8,2,"Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports."
1370,8_21323,8,2,In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
965,8_20918,8,2,"The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out."
1589,8_21542,8,2,When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
2359,8_22312,8,2,"Paul gets the information about Mr. Leonard from the high school track coach, and not from Mr. Leonard himself. Paul is a little disappointed the next day that he did not get the information directly from Mr. Leonard. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about his college career, and he explains that he was a great runner, but did not do well in the classroom. This makes Paul understand why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his track career, and Paul feels he needs to help Mr. Leonard as he helped him."
889,8_20842,8,2,"Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well."
1327,8_21280,8,2,"When paul gets the infornmation of mr.leonard from the URL paul is quite amzed that mr.leonard was an amzing track athlete. mr. leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter. that is until mr. leonard confeces that he cannot read, after that moment paul tells mr.leonard that it is his time to learn."
906,8_20859,8,2,"The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read."
1210,8_21163,8,2,"Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals."
46,8_19999,8,2,I think that when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he is inspired to be just like him. Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' this shows that Paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes.
2056,8_22009,8,2,Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an amazing track star and was an awful reader like himself. Paul also found out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the track team didn't want someone who could not read. This discourages Paul because this is a very similar situation that he could go through. In a way Paul feels comfortable because he knows that he's not alone in this because he has Mr. Leonard by his side.
450,8_20403,8,2,"Paul is shocked by the background information that he receives from Mr. Leonard. Paul first learns that Mr. Leonard won the four hundred meter hurdles at nationals and broke records. Paul is suprised by this because that is a great achievement, and is courious what happened after that and why he works at her school. He also learns that Mr. Leonard can't read and this effects him because she can relate to this because he also can't read and has to go to a learning center to get help."
