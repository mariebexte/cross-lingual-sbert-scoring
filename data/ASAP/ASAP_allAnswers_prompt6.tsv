6_14439	6	3	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.

6_14444	6	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell.

6_14485	6	3	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.

Transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane, as long as they fit.  Receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not, and let them through accordingly.  Glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane.

This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

6_14975	6	3	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

Also, carrier proteins, tube shaped, move things in and outside of the cell.Passive transport helps bring proteins into the cell.
6_15053	6	0	The cell uses threee processes by the names of mieosis, mitosis, and cell reproduction. Meosis is when the cell divides and turns into another cell aloowing them to increase in numbers. Mitosis Is when the cell membrane forms around the nucleus to protect it. ( this only occurs in Eukaryotic cells ).Cell reprodustion is when cells multiply allowing more cell to be created and a person be healthier.

6_15060	6	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.

Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
6_15068	6	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.

The cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode. If it didn't control what moves into and out of it we would most likely die.
6_15114	6	1	The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.

Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.
6_15117	6	0	The cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell. Then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell. Finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum.

6_15119	6	3	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.

6_15250	6	0	The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus. When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.
6_15251	6	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

6_15267	6	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

Another form of moving substances is passive diffusion, which is making the enviornment inside and outside the cell equal. This takes no effort and can move more than just water but other soultions as well. Lastly, another way to move a substance is facilitated diffusion which is moving a substaince against the concentraition gradient.

6_15999	6	1	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that there is a cell membrane which is semi-permeable. Semi-permeable means that only certain things can get into the cell. This type of membrane controls the movement of substances across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Another process used by cells would be information transfer where organelles in the cell transport DNA and rNA throughout the cell's system. A third process used by cells is when the lysosome come around and sort of 'clean up' dead organells and recycle them. This affects the cell because then certain organelles are dead and can no longer help the cell or move around in it.

6_16024	6	2	Osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion are the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. In osmosis, it is the movement from higher concentration to lower concentration across a membrane. The soutes are being dissolved in to the solvent and can readily do so on their own. With this there are three types of solutions: hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. In facilitated diffusion, it is movement from higher to lower concntration across the membrane as well with tings that can not readily pass through on their own. These then use the help of thing such as sodium potassium pumps and ion channels. in diffusion, it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration. These things do not need assitance passing through and can readily do this own their own unitl they reach equilibrium, in which all things are balanced and even.

Another method used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is the regular diffusion of water or other small particles across the cell membrane without the use of energy. Cells I don't believe can control the movement of substances here. Laslty is diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of particles again that are still small enough as if it was osmosis, but it moves differently. These particles move from low-concentrated areas to high-concentrated areas of particles.

This too, is a type of passive transport. A third example of a process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane is the sodium-potassium pump.  The sodium-potassium pump transfers 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell.  The sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport.  One other example is diffusion which is a type of passive transport.

6_16160	6	2	Cells can use osmosis to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Osmosis is when water difuses through a barrier to the other side of it. Diffusion also can be used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Transcription can be used, as well, to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Transcription is when a protein is translated and then moved across the cell membrane.

6_16163	6	0	The cell is surrounded inside by the cytoplasm. That holds all of the organelles together. The second way is to travel through all the organelles one at a time. The final way is when the substance is entering or leaving the cell through the plasma membrane.
6_16164	6	2	The first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport. This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is active transport. This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane, from being in a less dense to more dense side. This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis. The cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly, and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in, allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane.
6_16165	6	2	Cells have a selectively permeanble membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them.  This happens in two ways, osmosis and diffusion.  Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things.  One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport.  When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.  Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport.  Passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport.

6_16280	6	1	Cells use osmosis to move water across a permeable membrane.
6_16281	6	0	Each cell has a lipid bilayer which allows water in because it is polar and other subtances it keeps out. Another example is the cell wall of a plant cell which gives the call structure but also gives protction. A cell will also go through osmosis which is the process of bringing in water to the cell quickly. If nessicary a cell can use active transport to bring in nutrients that it normally would not use but at the time it needs.

6_16290	6	0	In the cells cell membrane, there are polar heads and non-polar heads. The polar head has a positive charge and the non-polar head has a negative charge. This allows water to flow through the cell.
6_16291	6	1	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are facilitated diffusion which uses proteins to allow water and larger molecules through the membrane by diffusion, Osmosis/ regular diffusion which uses the regulation of molecules on one side of the membrane be the same as on the other to keep water and small non-polar molecules in the cell and sometimes to get them out, and finally active transport by proteins is where a protein moves on the very outside of the cell membrane, grabs the molecule and moves back through the phospholipid bilayer to bring the molecule inside the cell.

6_16297	6	0	cellular communication cell reproduction
6_16298	6	1	Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane.  Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  This type of diffusion requires energy.     Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell.  These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion.
6_16299	6	2	One process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membreane would be active transport, another is diffusion and the last one is osmosis. In active transport you go from a place of low concentration to high concentration and for the other two you go from high concentrationt to low concentration.

6_16325	6	0	1. They have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell. 2. Most cells contain a nucleus, which is like a brain, that controls what needs to be done. The nucleus also controls the ER which exports protiens. So only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell. 3. Cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor. This allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise.
