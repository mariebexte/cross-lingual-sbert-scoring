en_cw_000659	black :: As black color is very darker and darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar.
en_cw_000660	light_gray :: To dog not overheated need to its color was light-gray or white.
en_cw_000661	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside a cooler\n temperature than the other colors\n I know this because on the data table it shows\n that the temp. of air inside the jar with the lid was 42° C.\n The temperature of air\n inside a jar with a black lid is 53° C
en_cw_000662	black :: When warming darker the color gives better results of air heating. Black has the best effect
en_cw_000663	white :: The darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.
en_cw_000664	white :: The doghouse would be more cooler because the average air temperature was lower on that case on the experiment.
en_cw_000665	white :: because temperature, the smallest warming is with white color.
en_cw_000666	black :: the best paint color is black because it will attract more energy and give a warmer environment to the dog
en_cw_000667	white :: the white color absorbs less temperature than the others
en_cw_000668	light_gray :: the result is to observe the behavior of dogs somoetidos to different types of color, this shows that dogs behave better with light colors than dark
en_cw_000669	white :: As shown in experiment with white color temperature was low so this will be low and that will be good for dog.
en_cw_000670	dark_gray :: dark gray is less susceptible to temperature change, which means it absorbs the least light
en_cw_000671	black :: The black color will retain the heat the best as shown in the temperature measurements of this experiment. Please note I am making a judging with an assumption you would want the doghouse to retain heat on cold nights. In hot climates where you want to minimize the temperature white is best from this experiment's results.
en_cw_000672	dark_gray :: the dark gray would affect the visibility of the doghouse since it would be darker inside it
en_cw_000673	white :: The light colors do not absorb the heat rejection, they reflect the heat.
en_cw_000674	white :: the lanco color is better so it does not absorb so much heat for a suitable temperature inside the house
en_cw_000675	white :: Using the data obtained by the experiment. The white color should be the best election for a hot climate. The fact of getting lower temperature results makes the dog house more comfortable for the animal avoiding hot situations and improving dog's quality life.
en_cw_000676	white :: the darker the color the higher the temperature of the dog house so white is the best color for the dog house
en_cw_000677	black :: black absorbs all the light so it increases the temperature of the glass. the light works according to the VIBGYOR process.
en_cw_000678	black :: the black color absorbs more energy, then the doghouse will be hotter.
en_cw_000679	white :: the color white because it does not absorb so much the temperature and keeps the doghouse cool
en_cw_000680	white :: It's the only color that won't make the inside termperature of the dog house increase
en_cw_000681	black :: - I chose the color black, because that is the most damaging color we could use for the doghouse.\n - This is explained, because the black color absorbs all the colors contained in the white light, so that the heat accumulation is greater.\n - The other colors, object of the study, also caused the temperature to rise but in values ​​less harmful and harmful than black.
en_cw_000683	white :: The white color is the one that best suits the design of the dog's house, and the color that obtains the lowest temperature
en_cw_000684	white :: USED A WHITE COLOR CASE AS THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE, WOULD BE LOWER AND BENEFICIARY TO THE DOG. THIS, ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT PERFORMED BY BRANDI AND JERRY
en_cw_000686	white :: The darker the color the higher the temperature. The choice of color depends on whether you want to increase or decrease the temperature in the doghouse.
en_cw_000687	white :: 42ºC
en_cw_000688	white :: the house will be colder in winter for lack of absorbing heat.
en_cw_000689	white :: According to the results of the experiment, the white color of the lid of the bottle produced the lowest temperature inside the bottle, therefore if the dog's house is painted white, a lower ambient temperature will be obtained inside the dog's house
en_cw_000690	white :: white color is the less one that absorb energy so the less temperature to the doghouse and will not affect the dog
en_cw_000692	white :: with the experiment the hypothesis raised is confirmed. Therefore, if we wish that the doghouse has a lower interior temperature, it is advisable to use the color white
en_cw_000693	white :: Definitely the color that would be best for this product would be the white color, because it gives a lower temperature than the gray and black colors, keeping the body of the dog to a corded temperature with its body temperature
en_cw_000694	white :: The white clothing not only reflects the sunlight, but also reflects the internal heat back to your body, so the net effect under identical conditions is less cooling than if you wore black.\n There are objects that reflect all the light, like white ones. As the color of an object is darker, it will absorb more light and therefore, the heat energy of the Sun. Therefore, the more light and electromagnetic waves a body absorbs from the Sun, the hotter it will be
en_cw_000696	white :: the white color is the best since it is the one that generates less heat
en_cw_000697	white :: white implies a smaller amount of ºC inside dog house
en_cw_000698	white :: I think the doghouse painted in white would be a fresh place for the dog, taking into account that it's a light color and air temperature would be low.
en_cw_000699	white :: as previously indicated in the hypothesis the darker colors tend to increase the temperature so the black color showed the greatest temperature increase followed by dark gray and light gray, while the white showed to be the color that lower temperature increases
en_cw_000700	white :: Painting the dog house white might result in a cooler temperature inside the dog house that is exposed to light/heat than if you were to use darker colors of paint. One thing to note is that the experiment tested results inside a sealed glass jar and a dog house is not typically made out of glass material therefore additional testing experiment with materials similar to the dog house materials would be needed to determine the validity of results.
en_cw_000701	white :: The darker color will increase the temperature of the doghouse faster than the brighter color. The jar reached highest temperature with black color and lowest temperature with white color after ten minutes. The white color, therefor, is more suitable for the doghouse.
en_cw_000702	white :: White is a color which has a minimum temperature savings.
en_cw_000703	black :: the best color for the doghouse will depend on the weather, for example if it is a temperate climate (with snow) then the black color would be better to preserve the temperature because the average temperature is about 53 ° C and if it were a hot climate (tropical) then the white would be better since there is a lower temperature 42 ° C, it is cooler.\n \n The color could improve the ability of the house of the dog is to conserve heat ... so the dog in cold period, could conserve its temperature and therefore its energy ...\n \n the reverse process also applies.
en_cw_000705	white :: The doghouse will not contain so much heat because light colors are not good containers to contain the heat
en_cw_000706	white :: White colore is more better.
en_cw_000707	white :: Because i have a dog and they like white color, maybe cause they like bone that have white color.
en_cw_000708	light_gray :: light gray
en_cw_000709	white :: It depends on the type of climate if you want it not be so hot, the best option will be the white color, but if is in summer the best will be the black since it generates more heat.
en_cw_000710	black :: A black doghouse would get warmer. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid got the hottest.
en_cw_000712	white :: Heat is danger for dogs and white is the color of the study with better results reflecting energy, with less absortion there will be less temperature.
en_cw_000713	white :: The white shows the lowest temperature in the doghouse which might be more appropriate for condition
en_cw_000714	dark_gray :: i think it wont effect it, they is no source of light inside doghouse, but i choose dark gray for no reason
en_cw_000718	black :: Black inside of the dogs house will make the house warmer because the dogs body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius and it will warm the house more then lighter color.
en_cw_000719	black :: The black color significantly affected the temperature of the house because the darker colors determine it, reaching an average of 53 ° C.
en_cw_000720	white :: Based on the results, the white color causes less temperature rise, that is, it is better for the dog's house
en_cw_000721	white :: As the booth is white, the dog will be more comfortably inside the booth since it will have less heat
en_cw_000722	white :: I choose the white because, it can be observed thanks to the experiment that this color is better for the temperature for a dog's house
en_cw_000723	white :: as it says the darker colors absorb more heat and according to the study the black is the one that would cause more heat and the house of the peroo would feel very hot
en_cw_000724	white :: white seems to me the most appropriate color for its clarity
en_cw_000725	white :: Becsuse black causes temperature to rise more i would choose white if i lived in a warmer climate. If i lived in a colder temperature area i would choose black. To keep the animal comfortable
en_cw_000727	white :: IT WILL BE SMOOTH AND BRIGHT
en_cw_000728	light_gray :: we can use a color that absorbs certain amount a good energy for the cold stations but not too much for the warmer station.\n \n we can see in the results that light gray clor could be used to do so.
en_cw_000729	white :: not to make it so hot inside the dog house
en_cw_000730	black :: dark color absorbs more heat energy
en_cw_000731	white :: Light colors, like white, do not absorb heat, they reflect it, that's why the temperature is lower.
en_cw_000732	dark_gray :: I choose this color because according to the results it has remained more stable without changes.
en_cw_000733	white :: Using white will mean the temperature of the air inside the doghouse will be cooler as it's temperature increased the least during the experiment under the lamp.
en_cw_000734	white :: selecting the color white for a doghouse would give a cooler temperature for the doghouse. hence, this color is suitable for doghouse design for country with hot climate. this was proven by the experiment result whereas the lid with white color has the least temperature rise compared to other lid color.
en_cw_000735	white :: The temperature affect does not very much
en_cw_000736	black :: black colour give the good way to provide them rest.
en_cw_000737	white :: white will make light
en_cw_000738	white :: the color might keep it hotter on the inside since the darker ones had higher temps at the start and end
en_cw_000739	white :: The darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature inside the doghouse.
en_cw_000740	white :: White color affect less the temperature inside doghouse
en_cw_000741	white :: But we don't know if Brandi and Jerry are living in a cold place or warm place. Do they want the dog house to be warm for the dog, then they have to choose black. Otherwise, if they live in a hot place, they have to choose white.. you have to add some information there!
en_cw_000742	white :: Because light colors absorb less solar energy, white would be the best option since the house would have a better temperature
en_cw_000743	white :: It would heat up the doghouse but not to such an extent as the others- on average raised the temperature 18 degrees compared with 29 degrees for a black roof. It still might be too warm for a dog though.
en_cw_000744	white :: white color will make doghouse more brightner and so it will be more spacious
en_cw_000745	white :: the white color, not generating as much temperature as dark colors. It is perfect for the doghouse
en_cw_000746	black :: the color affects the temperature, the darker the environment in teria will have greater absorption of energy
en_cw_000747	white :: A darker color house will be hotter in average than a light colored one, making it more uncomfortable for a dog in hot climates. This is drawn from the results, which show a decrease in temperature from darker to lighter colors. For colder climates, a dark color might be preferable.
en_cw_000748	black :: the black the color it will increase air temperature an make dog easier to breath
en_cw_000749	dark_gray :: After the experiment the Dark Gray showed that it does not suffer any alteration of the temperature so it would be the ideal for the dog's house. Taking into account that you can maintain the right temperature without showing important variations.
en_cw_000750	white :: ytbtgbybyhuyjnuyjnhgn
en_cw_000751	white :: It can protect doghouse for external high temperatures.
en_cw_000752	white :: It will be more iluminated, relaxed and comfortable. It will also be more fresh in the place
en_cw_000753	white :: The white color is the one that presents a more adequate temperature due to less heat absorption, which will allow the pet to live in cooler conditions and suitable for its healthier thermal environment. All this based on the experiment of the light bulbs and their thermal changes with the variables of the colors. Remember that the house of the dog can own a bulb and at the same time can be exposed to the sun, this means; that the most suitable color would be the white color due to the properties described above.
en_cw_000754	white :: white can be more comfortable
en_cw_000755	light_gray :: Light Gray would be a good colour for the doghouse. With light gray the inside of the doghouse would not be too hot or too cold. it would be a good temperature for the animal.
en_cw_000756	white :: The hypotesis was that dark colours absorbed more energy but the experiment showed that white colour keeps air fresher.
en_cw_000757	dark_gray :: Dark gray is the best dog house because the temperature is constant. \n I BELIEVE THAT THIS EXPERIMENT IS NOT RELEVANT FOR THE DOG HOUSES, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE \n OF GLASS. DOGHOUSE IS MADE FROM WOOD THAT IS BETTER TEMPERATURE ISOLATOR.
en_cw_000758	white :: The experiment showed that white color is more fresh, so the inicial hypotesis was wrong.
en_cw_000759	white :: IF the withe color keep the experiment cooler, then it shoul do the same for the dog house
en_cw_000760	white :: According to the experiment the darker the roof of the doghouse will be, the more sunlight can rise the inside temperature, so white will keep it as cool as possible.
en_cw_000761	white :: Using darker colors can make the inside of the dog house to hot for the dog. Having the dog in such high heats could essentially kill the dog very quickly. You would want to use a lighter roof in order to ensure that the inside of the dog house remains cooler.
en_cw_000762	dark_gray :: 45 47 43 45
en_cw_000764	white :: White color is not absorbing the heat too much, so it can make the temperature inside the doghouse not as high as black color. High temperature can make dog uncomfortable, especially in summer
en_cw_000765	white :: The black color absorbs all wavelengths, does not reflect any. That's why the temperature inside increases. Black clothing is a typical case, where the person will sweat more on a sunny day instead of wearing a clear clothing (which reflects the radiation wavelengths). For this, the best paint color for the doghouse.
en_cw_000766	white :: The darker the roof color, the higher the temperature in the dog’s booth
en_cw_000767	light_gray :: Light gray
en_cw_000768	white :: for white, the temperature changes slightly. therefore the best color for the dog house is white!
en_cw_000769	white :: in effect dark colors absorb more energy therefore more temperature
en_cw_000770	dark_gray :: I think dark grey would be best because it the color causes a consistent temperature throughout the experiment
en_cw_000771	white :: Effect of paint color on temperature
en_cw_000772	white :: According to the results of the study, we can say that the white color absorbs less energy, so the white color would be ideal for the dog's house. That way he will not suffer from heat.
en_cw_000773	white :: Different colors have different refractive qualities. Some colors are able to absorb more light that others. The small differences in each trial could be because of errors in the instruments or variables that were not properly controlled.
en_cw_000775	white :: since the color white is a color that absorbs less energy is more favorable than the darker colors used in the experiment, the experiment showed that a house for white dogs would have a cooler interior to accumulate less energy to heat the air inside of the structure.
en_cw_000776	white :: dsggsdgsdgdgg
en_cw_000777	dark_gray :: efdfsdfw4 jijuk fscsdv pk oo
en_cw_000778	dark_gray :: Dark gray can make feels the dog more confortable about the temperature, if is a sunny day It will feel like he can rest in a balance mode, if is a raining day the dark grey color will make it feel confortable
en_cw_000779	white :: The lighter the color, the colder the temperature inside the doghouse. It would good for a dog to live in a white house if it lives in a hot place, but a black house would be better for one that lives in a cold place.
en_cw_000780	white :: It's clear that darkest colors absorbs more heat, so if you paint the doghouse in black, the inside temperature would be greater than the same doghouse painted in white. A dog would be more comfortable in a doghouse painted in white.
en_cw_000781	white :: white is the best color for this experiment
en_cw_000782	white :: darker colors may absorb more heat emanated by the lamp so the best choice is white
en_cw_000783	white :: The average temperature of the white paint was the lowest, so painting it white would keep it cooler inside for the dog.
en_cw_000784	white :: White colour is less energy consuming. Using dark color is not economic , so to get efficiency we should use white as colour.
en_cw_000785	dark_gray :: The darker colours will result in a higher expected temperature inside the doghouse - as demonstrated in the results. As it is desirable to maintain a good temperature in warm and cooler conditions and that the front of the doghouse will be open, it would be best to choose a light or dark grey roof to achieve a balanced temperature inside the doghouse.
en_cw_000786	white :: the color of an object is the color of the light it does not absorb, this means black absorbs the full spectrum of light, which means it absorbs the maximun amount of energy possible, which results in a higher temperature, this is why white paint will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler, cause white absorbs no light/energy (in teory)
en_cw_000787	white :: The white color reflected most of the energy so the air temperature at doghouse will decrease
en_cw_000788	white :: Tests show that indoor air temperatures when white is used to cover objects exposed to light are lower than when dark colors are used. Therefore dog houses painted white will be more comfortable for pets
en_cw_000789	white :: The white color will allow the reflection of solar radiation, generating a lower temperature inside the doghouse. Being more comfortable
en_cw_000790	white :: as the data shows dark color absorbs more energy thus increasing the temperature of the substance so white is the color that can help to some extent in reducing the temperature of the house
en_cw_000791	white :: The color White is the most appropriate to paint the doghouse because it will keep it at a more pleasant indoor temperature.
en_cw_000792	white :: The roof of the dog's booth should be white. Since according to the experiment, the white color more reflects the sun's rays, and accordingly the insides will heat up less and the dog will be more comfortable.
en_cw_000793	dark_gray :: Yes
en_cw_000796	white :: White temperature is warm bot not hot; so the dog will not die for overheat
en_cw_000797	white :: In winter Black color should be used but in summer white color should be used. Inside of doghouse temperature could be maintained like a heater in winter, as black color will absorb the maximum heat from bulb.
en_cw_000798	black :: black, in a dog house will be warmer.
en_cw_000799	white :: as the darker color receive most of thee energy so the temperature increases, from the table white color is more effective in building structures
en_cw_000800	white :: It will cool more with white colour for the inside temperature.
en_cw_000803	dark_gray :: I chose Dark Gray. Assuming that you aren't sending your dog outside in the winter when it is very cold, I assumed you aren't interested that much in absorbing heat. Knowing that black absorbs the most and would keep it the warmest, I assume that would actually be too hot for a dog in warm weather. So I went with Dark Gray to make sure it stayed warm, but wasn't too hot.
en_cw_000804	white :: The best color is white because the temperature inside of the doghouse will be the lowest.
en_cw_000805	white :: Dog house painted white in the summer will be as cool as possible.
en_cw_000806	white :: The average Air Temperature in the doghouse would be lowest-Avg:42, If used white.\n If you want Air Temperature to be more warmer then you can go for light gray, dark gray and black, in that order.\n More the darker color more the temperature.
en_cw_000807	dark_gray :: The highest values are measured for black lid and the lowest for white lid.But since dogs have very good fur isolation, I would choose dark grey color for dogs house because that color shows constant value in the experiment, and it also ins't the highest or the lowest.
en_cw_000808	white :: White lid determines a smaller increase in the jar temperature, so the best color for the doghouse is likely to be white, in order to grant the dog a better temperature related comfort.
en_cw_000809	white :: The white color makes the dog's doghouse cooler.
en_cw_000810	white :: The color White will allow the doghouse to be more fresh and pleasant since it absorbs less heat
en_cw_000811	black :: will keep the dog's house warmer
en_cw_000812	white :: The white color of the doghouse will cause it to have an average temperature in the doghouse within 42 degrees C. It will be the lowest temperature of the subjects, but it is too high for the dog.
en_cw_000813	black :: black color absorb more energy and the temperature is higher. that is better for doghouse.
en_cw_000814	white :: The results of the experiment show that white gave the coolest internal termperature of the glass jars, thus I would select white, assuming that one would want to achieve the coolest temperature inside the doghouse of the four sample colours available.
en_cw_000815	white :: The white color have less temperature.
en_cw_000816	white :: Like explained on the steps above, darker colors tend to absorb a higher amount of sunlight, while light colors tend to reflect it, that is why a white doghouse would be the better choice if we want to reduce the temperature as much as we want.\n \n On cold enviroments, where some amount of heat would be needed for the dog's comfort, the other choices can be explored for extra warm.
en_cw_000817	light_gray :: the color varies depending on the elements that are used in this case varies with white and light gray
en_cw_000818	white :: in the summer the inside of the dog will not overheat
en_cw_000819	white :: White color absorbs less heat than other colors.
en_cw_000821	white :: Depends on the average temperatures in the region. White may give too cold and black too hot environment.
en_cw_000822	light_gray :: The darker the color the hotter it will get when exposed to a lot of sunshine. This may be bad in a hot climate, but a good thing i a cold climate-. So the best color depends on the circumstances
en_cw_000823	white :: According to the results the white color showed a lower average temperature, therefore it absorbs less energy, the house of the dog would be fresher.
en_cw_000824	dark_gray :: because this color is good for doghouse according to colors specialization.
en_cw_000825	white :: White color affects the inside of the doghouse without additional heat when the temperature is high outside.
en_cw_000826	white :: The color will affect the temperature inside of the doghouse, the darker the color, the hotter the house. Should choose the white paint so that the temperature of doghouse would not rise too much when it's exposed to the sun for a long time, especially in summer.
en_cw_000827	dark_gray :: dark gray gives more stable temp
en_cw_000828	dark_gray :: if the color is darker, keeps the light and focuses it in a certain direction
en_cw_000829	white :: THE WHITE COLOR REFLECTS THE SOLAR LIGHT ABSORBS LESS AND THE CASET WILL BE MORE COLD
en_cw_000830	white :: the interior color of the kennel should be white because it attracts less heat
en_cw_000831	white :: Lighter colors absorb less energy, thus temperature will increase less, preventing over heating of the dog house in summer.
en_cw_000832	white :: When exposed to a light source, the white color will still let the warmth of the light come through, but not as much as a darker color would. White has an average temperature of 42, compared to 53 from black, this is the best option for a dog house.
en_cw_000833	white :: It is very important to know what material lids were made of.\n What kind of lamp was used? \n It would be advisable check further changes of temperature.
en_cw_000834	white :: The lighter the lid the cooler the inside of the dog house because it won't absorb as much energy as a dark lid.
en_cw_000835	dark_gray :: black is heat absorbing.
en_cw_000836	white :: This color will ensure that the doghouse is kept cool in hot temperatures. The heat would be reflected and the inner part of the doghouse shall be kept cool.
en_cw_000837	white :: black gives higher temperature because it absorbs the heat from sun because it is black.\n dark gray gives higher temp less than black because it absorbs the heat as well.\n light gray gives less temp because it reflects the heat from sun.\n finally white is best know to give less temperature because it completely reflects the heat from sun . so white is the best answer.
en_cw_000838	white :: White is the best color for the doghouse because the temperature doesn't reach very high levels, that's better for the dog's health.
en_cw_000839	white :: the doghouse must be painted with white paint because it is the color that attracts less heat and makes the doghouse cooler
en_cw_000840	dark_gray :: dark gray，The temperature remained the same during the experiment, and all the effects on the dog house were small.
en_cw_000841	white :: The white colour will permit the doghouse to be more fresh and to not get hot with the sun, as it would happen it it was painted with a darker colour
en_cw_000842	black :: the color might make the house a few degrees warmer depending on what is used. i picked black because it seemed to have the warmest readings.
en_cw_000843	black :: I think the best color is black, because that color increase the temperature at most. That is important for dog expecially in winter months. Thank you
en_cw_000844	white :: white color will not absorb heat as other color do so temp will be better and cooler
en_cw_000845	black :: If the dog lives in a cold climate, then the booth it is necessary to use black color. Black color will be better to take and hold the color of the sun, for the dog so it will be warmer. But if the dog lives in a hot climate, it is necessary to use white color for the kennel. The white color absorbs less heat and the dog will be cooler.
en_cw_000846	white :: The absorption of energy is longer when they are dark colors, so the white color will make the doghouse even cooler because there is not much absorption of energy.
en_cw_000847	white :: If the color used it's darker, the temperature raise more. When the color is more darker, it absorbes more light and, because of this reaction, it gets warmer.
en_cw_000848	black :: The best color to use for a doghouse is black, to keep the dog warm and cozy. The black color will affect the temperature rising it, because darkest colors absob more energy.
en_cw_000849	white :: white color affects the doghouse by keeping the inside a cooler temperature than the other colors can do. this is because the data table shows that the temperature air inside the jar with the lid was 42° C. The temperature of air inside a jar with a black lid is 53° C. Clearly this shows that white is a good color to use because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool.
en_cw_000850	black :: It can be seen that the black color absorbs more energy in the dog's house, but thus resulting in an adequate temperature for your home.
en_cw_000851	dark_gray :: Dogs have a higher body temperature than humans. In winter, they must be warm, but the black color is not for the summer because it will be very hot in the cottage.
en_cw_000852	white :: White reflects more color, and the frequency emitted is redirected to the space around, being the blackest color the one that absorb the radiation and turning into UV, heating the premise of the doghouse.\n I'm going to compare the average of the black color with the white, knowing that the color palette of the colors between them are in a linear level of results for absorption.\n Black (53ºC) and White (42ºC), making a difference in 11ºC in average between the colors after 10 minutes.\n I live in a warm climate so the perfect paint to use is the white, to disperse more energy and making the doghouse more chill.\n If I lived in Russia, I would paint the doghouse black on the winter, to absorb and heat more the doghouse.
en_cw_000853	light_gray :: the more dark is the color , the more increase in temerature
en_cw_000854	white :: Not applicable
en_cw_000855	white :: the white presents change of lower temperatures that is why it is the most adequate
en_cw_000856	white :: the white for being a light color would make the booth keep a more pleasant temperature for the dog.
en_cw_000857	black :: It would increase temperature by a average of 11* C. This is useful for colder regions since even with limited sun light it will provide more warmth. Of course if the desired outcome is to cool then white should be used.
en_cw_000858	white :: According to the experiment, the white color would have lower temperatures, which would be more pleasant and bearable for the dog.
en_cw_000859	dark_gray :: Dark gray consisten
en_cw_000860	white :: According to the results, white is the best option and black is the worst
en_cw_000861	white :: No additional info needed
en_cw_000862	black :: The black color significantly affected the internal temperature in the experiment, having the highest increase of temperature among all the samples, because the black color is the darkest one, therefore, it absorbs more energy and, in this way, it generates a greater accumulation of heat.
en_cw_000863	black :: Black and other dark colors will attract and absorb heat from the sun and keep your dog warm.
en_cw_000865	dark_gray :: dark gray is better
en_cw_000866	white :: the white color disperses the light, helping the material that this white paint covers
en_cw_000867	white :: I choose white color because is less affected by heat
en_cw_000868	white :: If they use white paint, the doghouse should be fresher during summer
en_cw_000869	white :: smmsdeddd
en_cw_000870	white :: the white color reflects the light preventing the material from heating up to a lesser extent, using the white color because it is the one that provides the least remperature inside the base
en_cw_000871	light_gray :: dkddkdk
en_cw_000872	white :: The inside of the doghouse could become more heated with darker colors. To keep an animal cooler a light color might work better, especially in warm climates.
en_cw_000873	white :: In sunny days the dog house may become too hot with dark color paint
en_cw_000875	black :: the reason is when the lamp overheats and this means that it turns black
en_cw_000876	white :: the color chosen has an influence on the temperature in the cage which results in the comfort of the dog
en_cw_000877	black :: Black and white
en_cw_000878	white :: ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIMENT, THE WHITE COLOR IS ABSORBED TO MINIMUM HEAT SINCE IT KEPT A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE AND THEREFORE THE INTERIOR WAS MUCH MORE FRESH
en_cw_000879	white :: According to the results, white would be the coolest so perhaps the best color to paint a dog house. However, they just measured a small lamp area, and not a large doghouse sized area. I also think they should have tried more colors. And also, the climate where they are might help determine which choice would be the best for the safety of the dog.
en_cw_000880	dark_gray :: black
en_cw_000881	white :: The color of the inside of the doghouse would affect the heat absorption, white reflects more heat, black absorbs more heat
en_cw_000882	white :: According to the results the white color will absorb less energy which the dogs could have a more suitable temperature for them.
en_cw_000883	white :: The black lid had a greater increase in temp (53) compared to the white lid that had an increase of (42), thus the white lid indicated it would be best for a doghouse color so that the temp inside the doghouse does not rise to an uncomfortable level for your dog.
en_cw_000884	white :: White color would prevent the inside of the doghouse from over heat, it aborbs lees energy.
en_cw_000885	black :: black color lid absorbed the most light hence air temperature inside the jar is highest on all trial.
en_cw_000886	white :: Considering that darker colors absorb more energy therefore absorbing more heat energy the best option would be to make a white dog house so that the dog stays at a low temperature
en_cw_000887	light_gray :: In winter, the light gray color contributes to the optimal heating of the booth, and in the summer the dog does not live there.
en_cw_000888	black :: In the house, for example, dark terraces hold longer and longer sunshine heat.
en_cw_000889	white :: The lighter the colour the cooler the doghouse house would be, I presume the cooler the better in this case hence white produces consistently the lowest temperature after 10 minutes , conversley if the aim is the identify the colour that produces the highest temperature, black would be my suggestion, however in that case the dog would die more quickly as the starting temperature after 10 mins is higher than white.
en_cw_000890	dark_gray :: The inside of the dog house is warmer than the environment. Dark gray is a better choice because it provides the same heat effect at different temperatures.The white color would be the coolest.
en_cw_000892	white :: darker colors absorbs the most heat, because of can absorb all wavelengths of the light, reflecting none. Lighter objects reflects most wavelengths, absorbing less heat. That's why the temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was considerably lower than with the other darkest lids.
en_cw_000893	black :: goo job
en_cw_000894	black :: Black color have a more temperature.
en_cw_000895	black :: As you probably already know, dark colors (black) will heat up more than light colors (white).White reflects more energy than black does. Given two identical glass containers - one being of one color A and another being of another color B and that they would be filled with, say, some identical heated liquid, and then allowed to cool .
en_cw_000896	light_gray :: based on the applied experiment it gave me a gray color with denoted 7.5
en_cw_000897	light_gray :: We added a little more heat to the experiment, giving a light gray cond ence 7.2
en_cw_000898	white :: With white paint color the air inside the doghouse is less hot and then the dog can stay insude with less suffering during sunny days. From the experiment with white paint we have an average of 42 ° C instead 53 °C with black paint.
en_cw_000900	dark_gray :: 1
en_cw_000901	white :: affects so that it does not absorb energy\n and at less temperature in the air
en_cw_000902	black :: Black
en_cw_000903	light_gray :: Put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar.\n Make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24° C.\n Place lamp 5 centimeters away from the lid and turn on the lamp.\n After 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as Trial 1
en_cw_000904	dark_gray :: The results from the experiment show that the dark grey colour will keep the temperature consistent and therefore this would be the colour I would choose as this would be suitable for a kennel as it would not get too hot or too cold.
en_cw_000905	black :: Black would retain more heat which would be the best choice for the interior paint. Although dark gray had no variance, it did not attain a warmer temperature.
en_cw_000906	white :: In my opinion I would be looking for a room where the temperature is not varied quickly by external elements, I mean to say a gentle change in temperature is comfortable for me, and likely true for a dog. From the experimental results, I can see the white color paint gave the least rise in temperature from the ambient starting temperature. Hence my choice, of white.
en_cw_000907	black :: Well a doghouse is different because it is open to the air. The jar is closed to the air so the temperature will increase more drastically. It is still not a great idea to build a doghouse with black color because there will be more heat in there than a white house. The experiment should still work for a doghouse design and the lighter the color, should result in a lower temperature for the dog inside the house.
en_cw_000908	black :: the color black, has its pros and cons, since absorbing more energy than other colors .. this has to accumulate for longer ... in the day would be bad for the doghouse, but at night I would have more cold
en_cw_000909	white :: White color get cooler air in the doghouse
en_cw_000910	white :: White appears to be the color that is less prone to keep heat, so if we want confortable conditions the best color for the dog house is white, if it is going to be exposed to a constant source of light
en_cw_000913	white :: Put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar.\n Make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24° C.\n Place lamp 5 centimeters away from the lid and turn on the lamp.\n After 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as Trial 1.\n Turn off lamp and wait until the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature.\n Repeat steps 2 through 5 for Trials 2 and 3.\n Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the dark gray, light gray, and white lids.\n Calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color.
en_cw_000914	white :: How is the average air temperature measured
en_cw_000915	white :: The white color affects the interior of the doghouse in less intensity, since the average temperature inside the dog's house is 42 ° C, lower compared to the other colors, according to the experiment.
en_cw_000916	white :: The color of the outside affects the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. A dog could potentially get overheated if it has a darker color and it is built in a place that has the sun shining on it. For example, a black roof and outside of a doghouse could raise the average temperature by 11 degrees as compared to a white dog house.
en_cw_000917	black :: The black color absorb more energy
en_cw_000918	dark_gray :: If you use dark grey the temperature of the house will stay the same (48º in the experiment) therefore the dog will have an stable environment.
en_cw_000919	white :: According to the study the white would keep the air inside the doghouse colder, because it would reflect more energy. If the desired effect was the contrary (make the doghouse warmer) then the best color would be the black
en_cw_000920	white :: from the results the white color shows low temperature.
en_cw_000921	dark_gray :: I picked the dark gray since the results were constant for all three . It would be good to know if the temperatures would change making the dog either too cold or too hot for comfort. Not knowing what the optimum temperature I would like this would at least let me know that it would be consistent at 48.
en_cw_000922	white :: because the temp is fixed through the five Trial s.
en_cw_000923	white :: white
en_cw_000924	white :: 40 42 40 40
en_cw_000925	white :: airt temperature most down
en_cw_000926	white :: The results of the experiment suggest that using the color white as the paint color for the doghouse would decrease its inner temperature considerably in comparison with darker colors. This might be due to the properties of white paint, that causes a higher ammount of energy to be reflected and not absorbed.
en_cw_000927	white :: To have a normal temperature for the doghouse a white lid was the best and more sustainable temperature. They used four different colored lids and made three difference distances for all four the lids.
en_cw_000928	white :: A doghouse with white color has a very low temperatur.
en_cw_000929	black :: Because it is a dark color, it will end up absorbing more energy.
en_cw_000930	white :: The white color absorbs less energy, therefore the temperature inside the doghouse would be less if they had choosen a dark color.
en_cw_000931	light_gray :: put the black lid with the thermometer attached to the glass bottle, ensuring the initial temperature of the bottle is 24 degrees Celsius, after 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the container, repeat the steps with black light, dark gray, light gray and white
en_cw_000932	white :: blanco
en_cw_000933	black :: The darker the colour of the outer surface, the warmer the inside space will be. Black lids showed a higher temperature across all trials, while white was on the lower side of the spectrum.
en_cw_000934	dark_gray :: it may hp;d heat within
en_cw_000935	white :: Clearly the colors modify the temperature of the space according to the amount of energy that they are capable of absorbing and reflecting, so that the darker the color, the more energy absorbs and transmits to the interior of the container in the case of the dog house. convenient to use a lighter color that allows to maintain a pleasant temperature.
en_cw_000936	black :: taking into account the hypothesis implemented for the realization of the experiment, if the house is painted a very dark color (black), an increase in temperature would be obtained by the absorption of energetic
en_cw_000937	light_gray :: Light gray would be aesthetic and at the same time gives a very good temperature range compared to others. Although, the variance in temperature is inconsistent the rise in temperature is optimal. It indicates that light gray paint can help maintaining good temperatures in a doghouse in all seasons.
en_cw_000938	black :: How it's said by the suposition of the students. The darker colours are less translucid that the light ones, for different reasons. \n \n The light rays don't pass darker colours as they do with the light ones. What can cause retention of light, inside the glass jar, what direclty affects the temperature inside the jar, making it hotter than the light gray, or the white one.
en_cw_000939	black :: In cold climates, darker colors will absorb heat from the sun and keep the doghouse warmer inside. Light colors are good for warm climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the inside of the house cooler.
en_cw_000940	white :: It's too hot in black doghouse. Though the best way is build two doghouse: white for summer and black for winter.
en_cw_000941	black :: The doghouse will be hotter
en_cw_000942	white :: If the colour are darker, the dog house temperature will be higher. It is because from the result, we can see that the increase in the temperature is the highest when the lid is in black colour. The amount of increase will then decrease with the darkness of the lid from 29 degree Celsius with black lid to 18 degree Celsius with white lid.
en_cw_000943	white :: The table shows that the white color is the least heated. For a comfortable existence of a dog, it is necessary that the temperature inside a doghouse rises as little as possible. Therefore, the best color is white
en_cw_000944	white :: darker colors absorb more light and have higher temperature then, we can see that in results in this experiment.
en_cw_000945	white :: white paint color is the best because the color do not absorb too much heat compared to darker colour . the average air temperature isthe lowest and this is suitable environment for the dog to live since it will not be too hot when the surrounding environment temperature increase
en_cw_000946	dark_gray :: Dark Gray is the most acceptable color for a dog kennel. It maintains the same temperature.And the temperature inside the cage will be regulated by the temperature of the dog's body itself.
en_cw_000947	dark_gray :: Dark Gray color will be the best choice for making a dog kennel. It maintains a constant temperature. The dog will create for itself a comfortable temperature that will depend on the temperature of the dog's body.
en_cw_000948	white :: the white color is heated less by maintaining a temperature of 42 degrees creates an optimal state for the temperature of the dog
en_cw_000949	dark_gray :: The darker the lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.
en_cw_000950	white :: Considering a doghouse with direct sunlight, the best color to paint it with to keep a lower temperature inside would be color white. Looking at the results displayed in the experiment above, we can confirm that temperature inside a painted jar is lower the lighter the colour the jar is painted with, so that painting the doghouse white would allow our doghouse to maintain the lowest temperature when compared with the rest of the colors available.
en_cw_000951	white :: The temperature inside the dog house will be much less hot than the other colors.
en_cw_000952	black :: 50 54 52 53\n 52 55 57 53\n 54 54 54 54\n 60 62 60 61
en_cw_000953	white :: more likely that dog has more vision
en_cw_000954	white :: Black absorbes light so temperature rises. White reflects light so it stays cooler inside the house.
en_cw_000955	white :: The doghouse would be the coolest inside when having white as the paint colour and hotter the darker the colour became. Black would make the inside of the doghouse warmest, so white would be the best choice to keep the doghouse cooler.
en_cw_000956	white :: at white doghouse the inside temp is less and is best suited for dog body and dog not feel suffocation due to heating
en_cw_000957	white :: The lighter the colour, then the cooler it will be in the dog house.
en_cw_000958	white :: I have selected white color because white color don't reflect hot temperature and all the other colors absorb any black or blackish color ( any gray color) and the doghouse will be more warm .
en_cw_000959	white :: Building a doghouse in dark colors would cause it to overheat it in the summer. Building it in light colors would allow it to stay cooler instead.\n It's clearly demonstrated in the experiment since the black lid's temperature average was 53 while the white one was 42.
en_cw_000960	light_gray :: Stir the mixture until combined and then start rolling the mixture in your hands . \n \n if the borax ball is cracked, add more glue
en_cw_000961	dark_gray :: light gray color optimal temperature for Doghouse\n Trial 1\n 48\n Trial 2\n 48\n Trial 3\n 48\n Trial 4\n 48
en_cw_000962	white :: This color would keep the dog's house cool in the summer but in the winter it would need much more protection against the cold
en_cw_000963	white :: The color of the doghouse would greatly affect the temperature inside the doghouse.\n I would definitely choose the color white because it has the less effect on the temperature inside. Base on the table, the color white shows lesser change in air temperature.
en_cw_000964	white :: The experiment shows that the darker the color the more energy is absorbed which means that if it is hotter outside it gets hotter in the dog house and if its colder the more energy gets out. So in order to maintain a constant temperature in the dog house I would say the white paint is the best option.
en_cw_000965	white :: White colour will be best choice. As shown in the results that white colour absorbs less energy and hence it will maintain the cooler air temperature inside the doghouse and will keep climate inside cooler and not much warmer.
en_cw_000966	white :: According to the results the most appropriate color would be the white, because it would keep the house less warm than with the rest of the colors, the heat that maintains the white color would be bearable by the dog, the other colors would not make it comfortable
en_cw_000968	white :: from the experiment it is clear that white colour absorbs less heat so that colour is the best for the work.
en_cw_000969	white :: I would choose a white color, because according to the experiment is the color that absorb less energy. But keep in mind that a doghouse don't have a lamp and a white interior will get dirty quickly.
en_cw_000970	white :: Every color except dark gray and white will increase temperature in the dog house. Since the starting temperature is 24° C the dog will probably die on the sunny day.
en_cw_000971	white :: It was shown that the color that absorbs less heat is the target, therefore, to maintain a temperature similar to the exterior of the house, this color would be selected.
en_cw_000972	black :: according to the experiment is the color black
en_cw_000973	light_gray :: A shelter for the dog should have adequate insulation to protect the animal from both soil moisture and extreme temperatures.
en_cw_000974	white :: The darker colors provide too hot temperature in a doghouse on a sunny summer day. The white color ensures minimal changes in temperature, so it's the most convenient.
en_cw_000975	white :: The darker color the higher temperature. I chose White color for dog house so the dog wont be too hot on summer.
en_cw_000976	white :: In this experiment it shows that the three colors black, dark gray and light gray lid absorbs more light from bulb and increased the average air temperature in jar from 24 to 53 degrees .but white color absorb less light and the resultant air temperature remains the same as in trial 1 that is 42 so white color is more suitable for buildings.
en_cw_000977	black :: I chose the color black, because it is the color that could be more damaging to the doghouse inside, since the dark colors absorb more radiation, while the clear ones reflect it. Therefore, the heat would be suffocating and much more harmful.
en_cw_000978	white :: The least heating showed white color, other colors led to more heating.
en_cw_000979	white :: Lights colors tends to reflect light, wich has energy that could heat a surface. Then, when light hits surfaces with light colors, these surfaces tend to absorb less heat than dark surfaces.
en_cw_000980	black :: The hypothesis is right. The black is warmer beacuse darker colors absorb more energy. More dark more energy
en_cw_000981	white :: use the white color with which there is less temperature in the air since they absorb less energy
en_cw_000982	black :: the dark colors capture the color better, as we see in the experimebto the black one was the one that more heated
en_cw_000983	white :: red
en_cw_000984	white :: The inside will be cooler at the same exterior temperature.
en_cw_000985	white :: ambient temperature
en_cw_000986	black :: because the color black absorbs the temperature faster than other colors
en_cw_000987	black :: Energy is more
en_cw_000988	white :: it flexchuate with colouor as for white colour first it increase then there is a small chang in air temprature
