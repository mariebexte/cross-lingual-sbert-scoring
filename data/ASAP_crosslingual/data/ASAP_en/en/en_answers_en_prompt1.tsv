en_cw_000007	I don't need any additional information. I need samples, containers and that it.
en_cw_000008	as additional information it is necessary to know the result of the experiment
en_cw_000009	the wood is the least affected element with the vinegar after 24 hours was not affected in any way the limestone is the most affected of all its variation of mass is very remarkable
en_cw_000010	mix 2 samples at the same time and let stand after 40 minutes, then analyze results and then perform the procedure with the other 2 samples
en_cw_000011	1. Can do procedure with more masses.\n 2. Its better to take equal weight of starting mass.\n 3. Instead of 24 hours keep masses in vinegar for some days for better results.
en_cw_000012	It is necessary to know the amount of vinegar and concentration
en_cw_000013	Measurement of vinegar to pour into the containers\n How determine the mass\n Do the sample materials need to be the same shape and surface area
en_cw_000014	The amount of vinegar added to each container is missing\n The capacity of the containers\n Temperature\n materials
en_cw_000015	I think that a metal such as iron and aluminum should be included in the experiment, in addition to using another type of acid, sulfuric and chloridic acid.
en_cw_000016	vinegar\n material:Marble, Limestone, Wood, Plastic\n a scale to take the weight
en_cw_000017	I need to know how much vinegar is used in each sample.\n I need to know how much distilled water is used to clean the samples .\n I need to know the type of wood is. I mean from what tree he got the material

en_cw_000019	i need to know the acidic value of the sample elements.
en_cw_000020	It has to say what kind of material of the four types of sample it is not until the end that one deduces what they can be.\n You should also determine what the weight or average size of these samples should be.\n At the end you should check the results to know what they mean.
en_cw_000021	you need to know what amount of vinegar to put on each sample
en_cw_000022	after pouring the vinegar the mass should decrease or stay the same \n So next experiment they may watch for the mass difference
en_cw_000023	- The experiment itself does not merit replicate any.\n - The materials used as sample are of different type of hardness and therefore of resistance.\n - Vinegar, caused three of the materials used to be degraded in almost identical proportions.\n - The o
en_cw_000025	Size of the containers.\n Milliliters of vinegar to be added to the container.\n The samples must have the same size?

en_cw_000036	Exact parts of samples from marble, limestone, wood and plastic are necessary for a correct scientific experiment.\n Acid rain occurs and is formed when the humidity of the air is combined with nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide emitted by factories, power plants, heating boilers and vehicles that coal coal or petroleum products that contain sulfur
en_cw_000038	By what materials can I replace the samples?\n Can I do it with common water if I do not have distilled water?\n Can it be any type of vinegar?
en_cw_000039	iron, aluminum and copper
en_cw_000040	It's hard for a person who doesn't know bout this procedure as such. They should to explain why every single step says what it says. it looks right in general, but it would be better if we could to know why they apply that procedure and that way being able to understand a better way.
en_cw_000041	after the experiment it was determined that the wood does not lose mass after a prolonged period of vinegar.\n the plastic as well as the wood is not affected by the vinegar and finally the limestone tends to be very affected by the vinegar
en_cw_000042	Method for determining the mass of the different samples.\n Amount of vinegar to be poured into containers.\n Size of containers used.
en_cw_000043	In order to replicate the experiment, the size and the surface area of each material sample must be provided. In addition, the temperatures during the 24 hours and 30 minutes drying are also important for replication.

en_cw_000113	acid rain affects the type of material
en_cw_000114	Type of containers for samples\n Amount of vinegar for each container\n Average temperature for drying the samples
en_cw_000115	The amount of vinegar put in each container is never said to be equal. It should be said.\n I'd also need the room temperature, air himidity and a small description of the material used. Maybe if the material is too absorbent, a difference in the air's humidity and temperature could have an influence in the results.
en_cw_000117	Additional information that would help to understand the experiment and replicate it better would be:\n 1.- the masses of the samples before placing it in the containers.\n 2.- the pH of acidity of the vinegar used in the experiment.
en_cw_000119	kkj5356 4ed
en_cw_000120	1.- its about acid rain. 2.- vinegar can nt make acid rain. 3.- only the burned plastic and a lot f it will make acid the rain.
en_cw_000121	How much vinegar would I have to pour in each container? And, are conditions such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., important?
en_cw_000122	"I need first, when I must to determinate the initial mass, and I really don't understand the fourth step when they say ""rinse each sample with distilled water"", I think that could be a problem and can contaminate the sample."

en_cw_000129	1. Measure and dissolve samples in four seperate container filled with vinegar\n 2. Rinse with distilled water after 24 hours\n 3. Allow samples dry measure the final mass
en_cw_000130	You need to know the amount of vinegar that must be added to each sample, you have to record the temperature because it can affect the vinegar action. You also need to know the amount of water with which the samples are rinsed.
en_cw_000131	The materials to be used must be included. The exact amount of each material must be included. Explain the procedure and equipment to determine the mass.
en_cw_000132	chemical reaction takes place.\n most of the substances lose their mass except wood\n acid reacts on substances that cause reduction in their masses
en_cw_000133	The volume of vinegar will be needed to add more the specific weight of each sample

en_cw_000135	Plastic
en_cw_000138	How much vinegar.\n Sun ligth or not\n Free air or not
en_cw_000139	This is strange that pour vinegar contained in Marble and Plastic could change it mass. I don't think it is possible to change their masses even if vinegar is placed for years.
en_cw_000140	repeat the experiment again with each sample
en_cw_000141	acid rain has reaction on all the substances as the report shows that these substances has lost most of their respective masses.
en_cw_000142	The density of the samples to be included.
en_cw_000145	I would want to know how much vinegar was used per sample\n I would want to know how porous the samples are\n I would want to know the length of the samples used
en_cw_000147	To conduct such an experiment and its repetition, you should consider the temperature of the medium. I think it will affect the results.
en_cw_000148	How much vinegar must be used for four different samples? Do we submerge the whole sample in vinegar or just half is good? \n Should the containers labeled with 4 different samples be covered, when we leave it for 24 hours. \n Where should we keep the 4 samples for drying after rinsing with distilled water, in a container or something else, without affecting its Ending Mass?
en_cw_000149	How big containers should be?\n How much vinegar should I pour in containers?\n How big samples of different materials should be?
en_cw_000150	How big do containers have to be in relation to the size of samples?\n What is the range of allowable size for samples?\n Does each sample have to belong to fixed rock types?
en_cw_000151	What vinegar to use? What is the size of each container? A digital balance is required for weighing?
en_cw_000152	The volume of vinegar used for each sample and the specific weight of the sample are needed
en_cw_000153	The wood does not change at all.\n Limestone is what makes the biggest difference.\n The plastic presence of the second minor difference in mass
en_cw_000154	1) How much vinegar should be poured into each container?\n 2) What information should I give on the label?\n 3) What should be used for the accuracy of the scale?
en_cw_000155	which amount of vinegar should be purged? Can I use ordinary water instead of distilled water?\n whether the samples are dried at room temperature\n ?
en_cw_000156	1. The amount of vinegar used\n 2. The type of vinegar used\n 3. What material each of the four samples was made from
en_cw_000157	I do not understand why why this material Limestone loss from mass. What is different and why wood do not loss maass?
en_cw_000158	1. I would need to know if the samples where left under clear skies or where kept under roof. Enviromental factors would drastically affect the results.\n 2. If kept outside, it would be good to know the weather conditions of those 24 hours.\n 3. Lastly, was the piece of wood some kind of branch or was it actualli treated wood, with some kind of resin.
en_cw_000159	in modern physics every weight depends on its mass and size
en_cw_000160	What temperature vinegar?\n What is the fill level of the container?\n What is the volume of the container?
en_cw_000161	Samples of four different material, Staring Mass (g) and Ending Mass(g) of each sample.
en_cw_000163	You need to know vinegar and water quantities and count everything on the mass unit of material.

en_cw_000167	Another different samples\n vinegar\n Additional time
en_cw_000168	The concentration of the vinegar. The volume of vinagar in each container. Are the vinagar in each container has same volume?
en_cw_000169	i need more info about the weight, the shape, and hollow viscous
en_cw_000170	which is the shape of the material, quality of vinegar, quantity of vinegar, quantity of material
en_cw_000171	QUANTITY OF MASS FOR EACH SAMPLE\n AMOUNT OF VINEGAR FOR EACH SAMPLE\n TEMPERATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
en_cw_000172	the experiment shows that the vinegar acts on all the materials corroding them except for the wood that resist the reaction
en_cw_000173	I would ask for the size of the samples, if they have to be approximately the same size, or is that irrelevant?\n What kind of containers are required, similar to lab equipment, i.e. glass, or can any kind or container be all right?\n Is the vinegar household vinegar, or any special kind?
en_cw_000174	Pour an identical amount of vinegar in identical containers.\n What is the weight difference for all samples?\n Use four samples; marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
en_cw_000175	First, I'd like to know what kind of vinegar was used for this experiment. \n Are any special conditions required in laboratory? What were the containers made of?\n Were they wide open or had lids?
en_cw_000176	I would need plastic containers, distilled water and labels to label the containers.
en_cw_000177	Put tank in a mall.
en_cw_000178	How much vinegar need to be poured? How much time should the samples be rinsed? Which different samples should be picked up initially?
en_cw_000179	From the above we can conclude that all the 4 items placed in 4 containers are different in size and shape and in material when exposed to vinegar which is acidic in nature , that dissolved gave a result of slight change in shape and so there wont be any thing need to for the experiment to be replicated it is already is perfect.
en_cw_000180	I need to know the quantity of vinegar that was used, if the containers where covered and where I have to allow the samples to sit and dry.
en_cw_000181	the experiment shows that the wood does not undergo any alteration from the vinegar while the limestone is the most attached
en_cw_000182	Surface area of the sample\n Vinegar capacity\n The time when vinegar is put in is different
en_cw_000183	I don't think I need anything else to replicate this experiment, but they can point out how did they do the measurements and it can be writed with more precision and simplicity
en_cw_000184	youd need to have to know the size of the container, what was used on the samples for liquid as far as type of vinegar and its not in a controlled environment
en_cw_000185	I would need the new raw samples, a balance, heating device and clean new, containers
en_cw_000186	using digital balance\n dryer to remove any wet\n scaled containers..with marks to read the volume exectly
en_cw_000187	1. For the experiment it is necessary to know the amount of vinegar.\n 2. how each sample should be labeled.\n 3. in what room should be samples? Light or dark? Warm or cool?
en_cw_000188	The average between the input and output data. I think that the mean and variance estimators should be placed in the next two columns. as additional data.
en_cw_000189	How many degrees has te vinegar\n What kind of vinegar is used\n In which atmospheral conditions is the experiment run
en_cw_000190	To replicate the experiment will be needed vinegar, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Plus the containers
en_cw_000191	"first I need to know the hypothesis of the experiment to make sure whether it is supported or not which is ""after 24 hours soaking 4 different samples in vinager, the sample that has the smallest change in mass is the least one affected by acid rain from vinager"" then I need to know the exact volume of Vinegar to be added to the four samples to make sure that it is constant for the 4 samples.\n Also It is prefered to have constant weight of the 4 matrials as the time is costant (24 hours) so the intial mass prefered to be contant too to have more accurate data and I should have more trials at least three trials to have accurate results."
en_cw_000192	in the samples we can observe that the wood maintained its same mass, while in the other tests there was a small fraction of loss in some elements.
en_cw_000193	What kind of tree is it? What is the thickness of the samples? How much is vinegar?
en_cw_000194	The temperature, surface area of the samples needs to be the same.\n Needs the information about the container material and volume.\n Needs a step on how to calculate the difference in mass saying that is in need of doing a table. Realize a table with the results adding an extra column with the difference in mass calculated with the Ending Mass - Starting Mass.
en_cw_000195	temperature of the zone of experience\n weight \n volume of the recipients
en_cw_000196	Not applicable

en_cw_000198	repeat the experiment with the same steps but using different materials
en_cw_000199	Why would one use vinegar in particular? Can the same experiment by done with other substances? Any other conditions that need to be met when running this test to get meaningful data?
en_cw_000200	Include initial and final value of the color, texture and shape of the materials could provide more detailed results
en_cw_000201	Use this data to determaine result
en_cw_000202	after 30 minutes of limestone with more changes and the scale of changes in the wood did not suffer alterations of any kind
en_cw_000203	1. What amount of vinegar we need to use?\n 2. Do we need special environment during the experiment?\n 3. What tools we need to use?
en_cw_000204	After 24 hours, colect and mesure the vinegar left on the samples
en_cw_000205	You need to know how long each sample was rinsed in distilled water, what drying method to use and what size/type of container to use.
