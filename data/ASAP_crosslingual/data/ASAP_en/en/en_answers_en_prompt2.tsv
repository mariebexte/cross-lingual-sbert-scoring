en_cw_000331	1. Use light weight plastic.\n 2. Make a hole in plastic to hang.
en_cw_000332	based on the data in the table, it can be concluded that the samples A and B stretched (A 2 cm, B 1 cm), the sample C shrunk, and the sample D remained unchanged.
en_cw_000333	Conclusions:\n Different polymer plastics have different stretchability\n Plastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer\n plastics. \n Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics. \n \n Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results\n Indicate how many weights were added to the clamps\n Provide the before and after measurements for length
en_cw_000334	Take the plastic and put a piece on one side while the other one is firm. After 5 minutes, you can see the stretching of the material.\n Different plastics vary exponentially.
en_cw_000335	The amount of weight added to the types\n The initial length of the types\n The amount of tape put on each type
en_cw_000336	a. Material D was the more stretchable and material A stretched more on the second trial\n b. They could have performed 3 trials in total and then calculate an average
en_cw_000337	first two samples have bigger length, sample c have some shortage and sample d stay same length.\n You must same conditions for every sample, and watch exactly that weight is same for every sample.
en_cw_000338	at first glance, according to the results, the first sample is more elastic. he was able to improve the results by adding equal weights to each sample and using samples of the same length
en_cw_000339	UNA is the most elastic polymer of all in the experiment, the RE did not see any variation
en_cw_000340	take 3 types of plastic one more flexible than another, each plastic will be put to hold the same weight, after 1 elapsed one day the weight is removed and you see that plastic stretched more and which stretched less
en_cw_000341	Conclusion: There is minor difference after stretching plastic.\n 1. To improve the result student should increase time period of experiment, e.g instead of 5 minutes 1 hours. \n 2. to validate results student should repeat same procedure more than 2 times.
en_cw_000342	а.Different types of plastic stretch unequally\n в. 1)Plastic needed with the same length, width and thickness\n 2)Need the same temperature of plastic and the environment
en_cw_000343	a. The plastics have varying levels of stretch/elasticity. From least stretch to most: A, C, D, B.\n b. Does not state if the width or thickness of plastic was measured, these would need to be uniform across the plastic types for valid conclusions to be drawn.
en_cw_000344	the whole procedure is perfect
en_cw_000345	Conclusion: plastic is a malleable material, is deformed with the application of efforts. The student was able to leave more time the weights placed to the sample and could also use a source of heat to better visualize the process.
en_cw_000346	take the mass of each weight to know the resistance of the materia\n take the data of plastic fracture
en_cw_000347	The experiment concludes that not all the plastics reacts in same manner. Depending on which type of polymers are used on each sample we can get different results.\n The experiments might be improved using the same forces on each sample, and knowing the weight of the elements added to the clamps to make strength.
en_cw_000348	plastic type A has the highest elasticity rate\n avoid zero error when measuring the length of the plastic
en_cw_000349	the elasticity of the plastic is double the length of it before it is elongated.
en_cw_000350	the experiment would have more validity if at the end of the collected data had made some conclusions that contrast the results obtained
en_cw_000351	measure the actual size, tie a weight on one side and grab it by the other hand wait for a moment to remove the weight and then measure the resulting size
en_cw_000352	Fort most of the samples amount stretched was bigger in the second trial than the first one\n conclusion can be generaized that that seconde trial stretch is usually bigger than first trial
en_cw_000353	- The plastics used, according to their elasticity, responded positively in response to the weight load to which they were exposed. Only one of them remained with its properties and values ​​intact.\n - To be able to suggest a new experimental design 
en_cw_000355	The plastic D is the one that has lower elasticity. The plastic C can be like a spring, since in the second test it shrunk. Plastic a and B have good elasticity.\n To improve the experiment it is necessary to specify that the plastic samples must have the same lengths.
en_cw_000356	A) NOT ALL TYPES OF PLASTIC ARE STRETCHED WITH THE WEIGHT USED B) MEASURE THE PRESSURE OF THE CLAMP AND PLACE THE SAME WEIGHT (GRAMS) IN EACH OF THE SAMPLES
en_cw_000358	a. The different types of plastic have different elasticities.\n b. Measure the plastics with the weight still on. Perform more trials to get better statistics.
en_cw_000360	a-Plastic Type B has highest stretchability.b- use clamps insted of tape .
en_cw_000361	1 Sample 3 present inconsistency because instead of being longer they have a shorter length after the experiment\n 2 Before placing the weight make two marks on the sample, one superor and the other lower and measure the distance between these marks. After allowing the 5 minutes to pass, do not remove the weight and re-measure the distance between the marks and that is the measure to be taken
en_cw_000362	1- the weights of the clamp\n 2- the weight of each weight\n 3- any additional external factors to the experiment
en_cw_000364	a. the added weight is able to lengthen the plastics studied\n \n b. increase the number of samples, increase the number of repetitions
en_cw_000366	"The majority of polymers, badly called plastics, that we know and are part of our daily life are solid and of the most capricious forms. But in order to adopt these forms, polymers must be worked as liquids: dissolved or molten. It is therefore important to have suitable solvents for plastics. One of the most common polymers that we all know is the porexpan or white cork"", used in packaging. At the molecular level, it is a low molecular weight polystyrene (which is why it is used for packing) in which gas bubbles are trapped. Polystyrene is very soluble in acetone, especially in its lower weight chains"""
en_cw_000368	in general the plastics tend to elongate as we can see in the results the type a and b are lengthened, the c is usually shortened and the d remains the same.\n the student was able to improve the procedure by doing more times the procedure with the same type of material to see if the same thing always happens and if the same thing is always extended.\n can also make the clamp last longer with the weight to see if the plastic is deformed more or not
en_cw_000369	exerting a gradual pressure on each of the elements in question.
en_cw_000370	Plastic type C was the most stretchable from the other, getting more stretched by the weights added to it. Another way he could to do this investigation, is putting some weight above each polymer plastics type for a specific time, the one that gets more little than the other ones is the most stretchable polymer plastic type.
en_cw_000371	it was determined that sample A is the polymer with the highest elasticity, sample D was not affected by weight and sample C contracted
en_cw_000372	Three of the four plastic types tested showed an increase in length after stretching exercise. \n The student could have improved the experiment by\n 1) determining if there was a maximum weight/stretching pressure that could be applied to the plastic \n 2) determining if the plastic returned to original length after a certain amount of time or if the stretchability measurements were permanent
en_cw_000373	Plastic type B has the highest stretchability, followed by type B and type C. Type A has the lowest stretchability. The student could try different stretching times for each plastic type, and/or using different length for each type.
en_cw_000374	Longitude is growing in most of the cases. \n Bigger amount of types. and more meassurments.
en_cw_000375	Sample 1 and 2 are less elastic, sample number 3 is more elastic than sample number 1, 2 and 4. Sample number 4 retained its intact elasticity. It could have increased the number of measurements and numbers of samples to have a representative sample of a population. He could also have used more different types of materials, everything depends on his final goal.
en_cw_000377	the student may have been simpler to apply pressure to stretch the plastic and simply measure the elasticity capacity that would have
en_cw_000378	I'm sure their are now to do.
en_cw_000379	Nearest result is on sample plastic D\n and most dofferent in on sample plastic A
en_cw_000380	plastico a b c
en_cw_000381	a. For plastic type a and b the plastic tends to stretch, in the case of type c shrinks and type d is the same size.\n b. 1.- You can extend the execution time for more than five minutes.\n 2.- A heavier weight can be placed too.
en_cw_000382	Plastic type D does not appear to stretch. Ensure the weights and clamps used for each sample are identical.
en_cw_000383	plastic a b d
en_cw_000384	a. most plastics have the property of elongation when they are forced for excesive weight\n b. Using different kind of polymeres not just plastic and showing the exact weight used for calculation purposes.
en_cw_000385	Student could have used a different or more appropriate tabel of results,student should write the explanation of the tabel besides the table only
en_cw_000386	some plastic samples are stronger or weaker then another
en_cw_000390	It was better to take all samples of the same length and then measure after stretching. They could take samples, for instance 10 mm long, and then they could easily calculate the percentage of stretching. And also they should perform experiment more times to have more precise results.
en_cw_000391	I did not suffer stretching.\n B suffered a minimum stretch of 22 to 23 mm.\n A suffered a stretch of 10 to 12 mm.\n C did not have the only full stretch from 14 to only 13 mm.
en_cw_000392	in this experiment it is shown how each type of plastic reacts differently when a force is applied, changing its length
en_cw_000393	By placing weights on the polymer, it stretches, tending to maintain that state even after removing the weights.\n The number of measurements must be increased to reduce the error
en_cw_000394	In this experiment we wanted to know, the different types of plastics with their elasticity, putting them approved by fastening them to a table and placing weight to determine their hardness\n \n 1- The student rolls each of the plastics to see which has more elasticity.\n 2-The student heats it to a specific temperature to see which one stretches the most as it gets hot.
en_cw_000395	I should look for elasticity because it only shows the quantity, not the elasticity
en_cw_000396	the types of plastic present do not match
en_cw_000397	some types of plastic stretched more than others. Make sure the weight and size of each piece of plastic is uniform. Make pieces of tape uniform insize and shape
en_cw_000399	WHAT CLAMP IS NEEDED, PLASTIC CAN BE OF DIFFERENT TYPES SO BE SPECIFIC
en_cw_000400	I can conclude that diferent types of plastics have diferent stretchability.\n \n it is necessary for the student to provide the initial measurement of each sample.\n it is necessary repeat de experiment a larger number of times to take a average.
en_cw_000401	The stretched amount as a rule increase in the second trial
en_cw_000402	plastic is practically not plastic (not tensile under load). for more accurate conclusions, it is necessary to increase the length of the samples.
en_cw_000403	Conclusion: plastic is a malleable material, it deforms with effort. The student should place the weight for longer, additionally incorporate heat for better observation.
en_cw_000404	The analysis was based on the amount in millimeters of stretched plastics.\n Maybe if we had the final result with the final length after stretching the plastics would be a better result, more complete.
en_cw_000405	The results find that plastic type A is the most stretchy. The experiment would have been better if they had used the length of plastic for each type, it may also be beneficial to use more weight as the results don't seem to show much stretching.
en_cw_000406	based on the result, plastic type A stretched the most compared to others while plastic type D was not stretched at all. the experiment can be improved by:\n 1) control other variable that may affecting the final result such as doing the experiment in a controlled environment where no wind and sunshine present to affect the plastic stretch more or less that its supposed to based on its original characteristics.\n 2) varies the weight for multiple experiment to obtain more result to be analyzed before making the final conclusion.
en_cw_000407	It could be said that the plastic type with D1=20 no change except the other s
en_cw_000408	Remove the weights .\n Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample properly.
en_cw_000409	A= 10*12 = 122
en_cw_000410	a. plastice type d is the strongest and was undistorted \n b. the plastic types have to be both the same length and width to be more valid
en_cw_000411	Conclusion: Plastic type B has better stretchability. \n \n Improvement: Use a grip to hold the plastic firmly; measure the force of the clamp.
en_cw_000412	a. Plastic type A, B have stretchability while Plastic Type C and D no. \n b. The student could have used the method of stretching the lower side of the four types of materials to determine the same result by measuring the ability to stretch them.
en_cw_000413	the table is missing some information. It must contain the 'initial length' of the piece of plastic and the 'final length'. Other than that, you should write 'T1' and 'T2' instead of 'D1' and 'D2'.\n So, no conclusion can be drawn, because like I said: the table is missing information! Please review!
en_cw_000414	Let the plastic hang for a longer time. Add more weight to each of the plastics
en_cw_000415	B and D were stretchier. Perform another trial for accuracy.
en_cw_000416	we see that after many attempts procedure stabilize the amount of stretched plastic. I think here will be better a graphic parabola grafic to discribe the complexity of the process.
en_cw_000417	the student could apply temperature to the plastic
en_cw_000418	It is necessary to place heat on the sample to observe the yielding or breaking point of the material and the maximum stretch capacity
en_cw_000419	Data b shows that plastic B is stretchable, nothing else. Th experiment can be improved by taking more measures on different weights, not only two.
en_cw_000420	a. from the research above the plastic type A has better stratchabillity than the other plastic type. \n b. the student should did trail for three times to make data valid\n the plastic type should be known
en_cw_000421	According to what can be observed in the description the student wanted to measure the malleability and the ability to yield the plastic. Of course depending on the density and quality of the plastic material will influence its etiramiento. I would recommend the application of a greater weight.
en_cw_000422	trgythtyhty
en_cw_000423	Plastic elasticity is not same in the firs and second trial.We should find experiment which will gave us more reliable results. a.Physical stretching with pulling, b.stretch with banding
en_cw_000424	There's no significant difference in the results.\n Maybe use differents instruments and materials
en_cw_000425	The property of elasticity predominates in the polymer data, taking into account that most of the polymers in question had a greater length after the experiment. It is recommended to specify the weight to which they were exposed, and also a better wording and organization in the data table added to the specification of the thickness of the tubes since it is an important variable.
en_cw_000426	a must be more
en_cw_000427	Conclusion: Three of the plastic samples stretched a fraction while one of the samples actually shrank.\n The student could have mentioned what types of plastics he/she used and what weights were used. Also were all the plastic samples the same width.
en_cw_000428	Plastic types A and B stretched but D didn't and C even got shorter. I think in order to improve this experiment, the student could have examinate plastic type C and find out why it did not stretched.
en_cw_000429	a. Different types of plastics have different extensibility. \n b. The measurement was performed before weighing the weights. So the experiment would be more valid.
en_cw_000430	Plastic types A B and C changed but D stood the same. On the other hand, C got shorter. The student could use more types of plastic to see if these also get shorter or the same.. And why.
en_cw_000431	"He should use a ""control"" plastic and use together with the plastic with the heavy"
en_cw_000432	Conclusion is that not all plastics have the same stretchability, but some types become more stretchable the more we work on them.\n Providing the thickness of the samples would have had improved the validity of the results, also it should specify how many weights were added to the clamp.
en_cw_000433	Plastic type D stretches the most. They could have made sure to hang the weights only for a specific amount of time and used the same time each round of stetching. They should have made sure that the clamps all weighed exactly the same so as to not make the results invalid.
en_cw_000434	C\n \n 11\n \n 15
en_cw_000436	A. different type of plastic has the different intensity of elasticity\n B. 1. student could mentioning the spesification of the plastic, like the thickness, etc\n 2. they should mentiioning the weight of the clamp and the objects that clipped to it, to make the experiment more clear
en_cw_000437	Sample A was the one with the highest stretchability (10%). Sample D did not register any stretchability. Samples B and C also have stretchability. \n \n \n For the results to be valid and to be able to compare them, the length and width of each plastic sample must be the same. Another recommendation is that the weight on the bottom edge of the plastic sample should be the same.
en_cw_000438	Experiment C data is not real. It is necessary: 1) to check the weight of the cargo; 2) check the time the sample is under the weight
en_cw_000439	A
en_cw_000440	conclusion:\n least of all deformation the sample of plastic under a letter D, he the steadiest against mechanical influence is subject to influence.\n 1.Samples have to hang much more than 5 minutes. Because time of influence isn't enough, for obtaining objective results.\n 2.Use horizontal stretching, not vertical.
en_cw_000441	the tests to the plastics should have been carried out simultaneously
en_cw_000442	depending on the plastic type the sample either stretched, shrank, or stayed the same. the results could be improved by listing the starting length before it as stretched as well as the specific type of plastic used.
en_cw_000443	Resilient of Polymer
en_cw_000444	The type of plastic UNA has more elasticity. compared to the other three types.\n 1- should indicate that the amount of weight was the same for all types of plastics included in the sample.\n 2-had to indicate that the four samples should have the same length.
en_cw_000445	Maybe the amount of weight added to the clamp wasn't exactly the same. No piece of plastic is equal. I'd make sure that both plastic samples used are as similar as possible.
en_cw_000447	the plastics have different elasticity, each one showed a different amount of mm in the first experiment as well as the second experiment.\n a.- the explanation of what he wanted to show with the experiment itself.\n b.- measure the plastics hanging on the table before putting the weights on them (this would show their elasticity better).
en_cw_000448	sdjubbyb yvybwud
en_cw_000449	vdwfwf5474
en_cw_000450	1.- Studing more quimic 2.- The plastic needs to be more exposed to the fire
en_cw_000451	a) Plastics A and B ended 2 and 1 mm (respectively) longer than before, D didn't stretch and C ended shorter for some reason. \n b) You could specify what type of plastic was each one (a, b, c, and d). Also it would be useful to know the measurements (weigh, length, etc.) of the clamp.
en_cw_000452	a. The piece of plastic A has a bigger coefficient of elasticity than other samples with a 20% of increase in length.\n b. First, they could measure the length of plastic without removing the weight and clamps. Second, they could calculate the percentage of change, that way they would have a better point of view of how each plastic could change in those conditions.
en_cw_000453	all the options proposed are ideal for work
en_cw_000454	trying to do the experiment in other kind of surface (a curved one).\n trying to strecht it with the hands to see the result.
en_cw_000455	Plastic D was the strongest, because it didn't stretch, it stayed the same length. They should have used plastic that was all the same length and reported how much weight he used.
en_cw_000456	Student can find the elasticity of the matter as conclusion from this experiment and there should be much more data available like length units . Design must be specific to matter wise in details.
en_cw_000457	a. Plastic type A stretched the most proportionally.\n b. They could additionally measure the length of the plastic with the weights still attached.\n The should use the same length of each plastic sample.
en_cw_000458	a. sample b is the moststratchable material and a the least.\n b. - heigh for the table, length spected for the samples (you can mesuare them after to get a more accurate read but is better if you use an aproximate target length this way the next person doing the experiment i not to cut 30ft long pieces and need a mile high table)\n -mass of the weights to use, for this experiment to be replicable all test should use the same mass
en_cw_000459	a. There is no stretchability on sample D\n b. Student could experiment with all samples together attached to clamp and weight
en_cw_000460	a. The plastic that stretched the most was A (20%), followed by C (7.14%) and B (4.5%), the D did not stretch.\n b. The same length must be defined for all samples. You must specify the weight that is added, which must be the same for everyone. You can try different weights and varying times.
en_cw_000461	The elasticity of the materials is different, the material B turned out to be the most elastic. The student had to increase the size of the sample, and respect the principles of the design of experiments, so that the data are valid.
en_cw_000462	plastic are elastic produce elasticity when external force is applied in the form of weight. the reading shows A and B are more stretched while C is lower than its elastic limit
en_cw_000463	The conclusion would be that not all plastics are elongated with the same weight, so they have different properties.\n The results could be better if plastics are placed horizontally pulled by forces greater than gravity.
en_cw_000464	1 way\n use locksmith vice\n 2 way\n shoot it all on video
en_cw_000465	B
en_cw_000466	The conclusion would be that not all plastics are elongated with the same weight, so they have different properties. The results could be better if plastics are placed horizontally pulled by forces greater than gravity. In this way, all
en_cw_000468	Record the weights used.\n using two rounds of weights
en_cw_000469	In this experiment, you will be qualitatively analyzing plastic polymers for physical characteristics of opacity, flexibility, durability, and breakability. You’ll also analyze the density of each plastic by checking whether pellet samples float or sink in three liquids of different densities.
en_cw_000470	the polymer is stretched. increase hover time under load.increase the weight of the load.
en_cw_000471	the experiment shows that when external force is applied on the rubber band it experience a stress upto elastic limit\n A and B shows increase in length C has reduction
en_cw_000472	Plastic Type D is the most stretchable (20mm) and the shortest is A (10-12mm).
en_cw_000475	It appears that in half of the experiments that the plastic stretched more the 2nd time. I would assume this means that the first stretching might have impacted how much it would stretch the 2nd time.\n I would change the graph presentation as it appears they are calling the samples D1 & D2 on the chart, but it was called T1 and T2 in the explanation. \n They also could have done all of the 4 experiments (with assistants) at the same time rather than one after the other because perhaps other factors in the room (humidity, temperature) could impact the results.
en_cw_000476	a. Conclusion: B has more stretchability than the others. A has the least amount of stretchability .\n \n b. - Checking the thickness of the samples\n - Do more than 2 trials
en_cw_000477	"The most tensile plastic ""A"" judging by the results of the experiment."
en_cw_000478	All plastics don't get stretched. Some plastics may even shrink or stay the same in length.\n Students could have used clamps on both sides instead of tape.\n They could use more number of clamps for all 4 different plastics at the same time, so that trial time can be reduced.
en_cw_000479	First of all procedure and data from the table are not marked in the same way.T1 and T2 in procedure and D1 and D2 in data table.What is interesting in data table is that data for plastic type C was 14 after first trial and 13 after second.How is it possible?And what kind of weight was used for streaching plastic?It looks like plastic type D is the most solid, or the weight that is used wasn't proper.
en_cw_000480	How much weight do i have to add in total?\n How much weight is needed for each step of load?\n Does the length of plastic samples have to be the same?
en_cw_000481	Indicate what type of plastic used.\n Indicate or put legend in the table. indicate what is D! and D2
en_cw_000482	Not all plants are elongated and requires a greater force than gravity to elongate all plastics
en_cw_000483	Type A presents a larger difference from D1 to D2. \n Test for more minutes.\n In some test the same plastic for different periods of time.
en_cw_000484	The student should check the load at which the plastic will be broken.\n The student should give it the ambient temperature when trying to load the plastic.
en_cw_000485	Plastics grow in most cases\n weights on the clamp could stay a little longer than 5 minutes\n the lenght of the plastic could have been measured a couple of times to get a better result
en_cw_000486	Conclusion: Results were relevatively consistent throughout both experiments with only minimal variation with plastic A having the most variation and plastic B being the stretchiest.\n \n It could be improved by including the types of plastic in the final results, as opposed to being referred to by just their letter designation.
en_cw_000487	Plastic type A grow up from 10 to 12, but C from 14 become 13.
en_cw_000488	1. Shape of samples: different shapes present different characteristics.\n 2. Weigth added, this is needed in order to know if any sample was brought to a weight where it actually deforms insted of stretch.\n 3. Not sure if really relevant but the time the weight was applied should be known, some plastics have higher resistance but still stretch slowly.
en_cw_000489	as before: the size will help in the stretching of each of these
en_cw_000490	specify plastic shiren\n specify the weight of the load
en_cw_000491	Plastic Type A is expands more than other type. The student can use heavier weights and allow them to hang for ten minutes.
en_cw_000493	a. Plastic A is the less and plastic B is the most stretchable. \n b. Would be better to clamp also the top edges, take say 1 meter of each tape and measure the length with hanging weights additionaly. Also would be good if weights would be say 1 kilo each.
en_cw_000494	B and D can be streched more than A and C\n Improve the fixing of the tapes\n improve the addition of weight
en_cw_000495	The experiment has few data to reach a conclusion, ways in which it could be improved: 1.- Increase the time of the test. 2.- Submit the polymers at different temperatures to determine how much it affects its elasticity or if this makes it acquire other properties.
en_cw_000496	it will not be possible that mass will increase
en_cw_000497	It should be better to have lenses instead of table. Several weights of the same form.
en_cw_000498	a. plastic B has best stretchability and plastic A has the worst. b. 1. Should repeat trial for more times because some value is close, like the stretched amount of type A and C. 2. Should keep the shape and volume and mass of the plastic samples all the same. 3. Change the weight of weights and do the trial again.
en_cw_000499	the b is weakest one. c is better
en_cw_000500	The weight must be heavier than the plastic mass, The tape of top must be of high quality to withstand the weight
en_cw_000501	TEMPERATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT \n AMOUNT OF AGGREGATED WEIGHT \n TYPES OF PLASTIC
en_cw_000502	the experiment shows that the type of plastic D does not undergo variations in length because it is certainly more resistant and less elastic
en_cw_000503	Different types of plastic stretch differently. Two samples stretched, while one even shrunk, and the fourth remained the same.\n Make sure the exact same weight is added to each sample, and try different duration of time.
en_cw_000504	a. Type D does not stretch even under pressure from the weights\n \n b. Start with samples that are all the same length.
en_cw_000505	Was the second trial performed on same samples user in the first one? \n What exact types of plastic were used (if I used another type of plastic, my results would significantly differ)? \n How heavy were weights used for the experiment?
en_cw_000506	The conclusion is there was not much difference in stretch.\n the students could have used a different type of weight instead of a clamp.
en_cw_000507	Plastic type A is more stretched than the other.
en_cw_000508	Plastic type A has more stretchability.\n Instead of taping to the table upper edge could have been tightly fixed.\n Hang for at least 10 minutes to get better results.
en_cw_000509	b) 1) taping does not really work when a high object is used to stretch the plastic i recommend to tie it up to iron object that is study and strong.\n 2) the other end should be tied up with a heavy object for 5 minutes then removing will give a very good result.\n The results are perfect and for the D part though.
en_cw_000510	a. Conclusion: The type of polymer plastics influence in its stretchability.\n b. He needs to put on the table: The type of polymers and the initial and final measures.
en_cw_000512	Scalability from large to small：A>B>D>C\n Increase the weight of the weight
en_cw_000513	I think that's not much probability of plastic C has less mm after streched, unless it has been broken. The plastic A is the more streachble.\n In my opinion the student must calculate a percentage of strechability and do the mean of the two experiments. I will also like the experiment to have 3 repetitions instead of 2.
en_cw_000514	he could list what type of pastic he uses. different mm of plastic stretch in different ways. this is not really valid because of that issue. the stretches could be non linear making the measurments different in different areas of the plastic
en_cw_000515	The plastic streched by additional weight, i.e by force of gravity. The experiment must be performed in straight conditions and that you could change for example temperature, humidity or other....
en_cw_000516	use light weight adhesive material\n use easy remove adhesive type
en_cw_000517	the first two samples were slightly stretched, the third somehow decreased, and the fourth remained unchanged.\n for the validity of the results, the student had to specify the weight of the goods.\n also the student had to specify in what way he fastened the top part of a sample to a table.
en_cw_000518	The experiment gave positive results for both the first and second samples and obtained positive results of plastic stretching. But for the last and the last, the results were not good.
en_cw_000519	a. Polymers A and B tend to be bigger with the weights, and C and D tend to stay the same or even being shorter after the test.\n \n b. Expicify the amount of weight used maybe.
en_cw_000520	D plastic didn't stretch cause of its composition, it must have been harder that the rest. Maybe the student could have improved if he let the plastics more time hanging
en_cw_000521	We can see from the data that plastic type B stretched the most being 22 mm T1 and 23 mm T2. The students should have made the experiment better if they did one more trial also they should tell me the amount of weight you add to the plastic. To be more specific.
en_cw_000522	in sample number one we can see that the plastic obtained a stretch of 2 millimeters in comparison to the others.
en_cw_000523	Why is one sample shorter? What is the thickness of the samples? Is there a change in room temperature?
en_cw_000524	a) The plastic type D is more resistant then the others and A being the stretchiest of them all with 2mm of amount stretched in 5 minutes.\n This experiment cannot be validated because the D1 needs to be the same for all plastic samples.\n There is no information of what volume, surface area and temperature of the elements of the experiment.\n There is no information about the weight of the weights.\n This experiment has no validity of the results.\n If they fixed the values for all the experiment being the variable only the stretching, it could be a valid and legit experiment.
en_cw_000525	the Amount stretched in D1 is less than in D2\n try with more accurate measure tools.
en_cw_000527	the type of plastic In exchange more in comparison with the D that did not undergo any change
en_cw_000528	perform a third test T3
en_cw_000529	I am not sure how thorough this experiment can be based on the description. Maybe add more information about the weights used and repeated this experiment several times, at least 2-3 times for each different weight class.
en_cw_000530	In conclusion, the experiment shows that some types of plastic can be deformed by subjecting them to stretch processes for a certain amount of time. Adding heat and / or pressure to the materials could help improve the results of the experiment.
en_cw_000531	Have 4 sample
en_cw_000532	A and B changed their form for their part C was reduced and D was not altered
en_cw_000533	No additional info needed
en_cw_000534	All plastics had a significant deformity in the short time that they were submitted to the elasticity.\n \n One way of improving the experiment would be to leave the weights until the break, to test the maximum point of elasticity, and another way would be to measure the samples also after 5 minutes of the removal of the weights, to see how much they would return to the original length.
en_cw_000535	The plastic used to make dry cleaning bags is weaker (more likely to stretch or tear) than\n the other plastics: the plastic dry cleaning bag stretched 23 mm, which was more than the\n other plastics
en_cw_000537	you will see the plastic grow
en_cw_000538	The order of highest to least elasticity of materials is A, C, B, D.\n \n increase the length of the original samples (required).\n \n increase the measurement accuracy to microns if the sample is still small
en_cw_000539	a) Something is wrong because the sample C is shorter after the experiment.\n b) The student should say the mass for the weight
en_cw_000540	He could have written which kind of plastic sample he had used, their specific weight and how much weight he attaches to each sample
en_cw_000541	mmmm
en_cw_000542	A. it is shown that the elasticity of material A is greater than the others followed by C, B and D\n \n B. increase the length of the sample and increase the time when the weight acts on the sample
en_cw_000543	ksskksks
en_cw_000544	I would conclude that some plastics are more elastic than others. \n The students could improve the experiment by using the same size plastics to start with, same length and width. They could also add a step to see how much the plastic shrunk once the clamps and weights were removed. I also would question why Type C actually shrank.
en_cw_000545	Describe the mass of the weights attached to each identical plastic strap.
en_cw_000546	there are found some samples of type of plastic will stretched but the other will Shrinks
en_cw_000547	the departure mass is subtracted with the final mass and the result is the difference in plastic
en_cw_000548	a. the type of plastic and the distance stretched are directly proportional\n b. measuring the changes that occur, the initial data must be determined, after the experiment is done the final data is found
en_cw_000550	ACCORDING TO THE DATA, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF ELASTICITY AMONG THE FOUR ELEMENTS BEING 2 OF THEM MORE ELASTIC.\n 1. IT COULD HAVE EXPOSED THE ELEMENTS TO THE MODERATE HEAT TO PROVE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE POLYMER\n 2. IN THE SECOND PROOF YOU HAVE TO USE OTHER ELEMENTS TO VERIFY IF THEY REACT IN THE SAME WAY
en_cw_000551	From this chart, I would conclude that B is the stretchiest polymer, and A is the least stretchy. I think one way to improve the experiment is to use something stronger than tape to hold the top down, because if the tape comes loose, that can make the results inaccurate. I also think they should have some sort of control to compare these with.
en_cw_000553	a. Conclusion is that Plastic type A has stretched the most and plastic type D has stretched the least\n b:\n 1. Start with equal lengths of plastic\n 2: Clamp the plastic at the non weighted end so that there is no bend, which would be caused by hanging from the table. This will ensure there is no weak point which could cause extra stretching
en_cw_000554	The conclusion is that the elastic materials will extend according to their nomenclature or resistance. \n 1.- could expose them some type of greater resistance. \n 2.- place them in different environments. \n 3.- place them for much longer
en_cw_000555	I believe we should have had beginning measurements to get a good picture of what the experiment is trying to show. Also, it mentions T1 and T2, but in the chart there is listed D1 and D2, which is confusing. What are the Ds for?
en_cw_000556	a: The plastic Type A is more stretchable\n \n \n b: 1- The samples' length should have been measure before the experiment to make sure it was the same in all cases.\n 2- The clamp's weight should be determined before the experiment and shouls be the same in all cases
en_cw_000557	what is the length and width of sample.\n \n how much weight should be attached. \n \n what is the duration of the experiment.
en_cw_000558	We can observe that plastic C and D did not show any considerable elasticity. the C contracted unlike the A and B that some type of elasticity was appreciated that indicates that not all plastics (polymers) have the same elastic capacity.\n To improve\n 1.- What type of polymer are you using in the experiment?\n 2.- As an additional data, test the elasticity of the material under high temperatures in addition to check the resistance elasticity would be evaluated
en_cw_000559	a) the longer the sample, the more tensile\n b) it is necessary to increase the length of the decoration or to drain the weight of the load
en_cw_000560	He could measure another type of plastic load.
en_cw_000561	Plastic D is the most predictable sample as the stretched length is the same in both trials.Improvements/validity (1) State that the weight is the same in every case (2) State the precise place the clamp needs to go at the bottom edge (middle, left, right or xyz mm from the bottom. (3( do more trials using the same process, this would further prove the plastic D finding.
en_cw_000562	The average elongation is between 10% and 20%. The longer the glued plastic strip, the more elongated, the less elongated. It would have been better to experiment with a number of strips of the same length, but with different thicknesses, for it would have been more egalitarian.
en_cw_000564	Performing an additional third trial (T3)\n Adittional time frames (5m, 10m, 30m...)
en_cw_000565	i don't know what you mean
en_cw_000566	For A Amount is more, but for C is lower.
en_cw_000567	here the conclusion is the different polymer plastic for stretchability is successfully done in this investigation.
en_cw_000568	Different type of plastic have different elastic modulus. To improve experiment shoud increase the weight to draw a graphic Load- Streth. Another improvement shoud be to determine the section of the sample, better if secrion is a circle.
en_cw_000569	es mejor que el equipo donde se este ensayando la muestra este calibrado con su respectiva medicion ya que luego de haber terminado tiene mejor precision en los resultados
en_cw_000571	good we can see that the plastic can reach stretch little or a lot or nothing depending on the material of the plastic.\n is valid because it is experienced with a weight to slightly force the length of the plastic
en_cw_000572	D
en_cw_000573	Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.\n Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.\n Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.\n Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
en_cw_000574	The conclusion is that plastic A was the most stretchable material.\n Each piece of plastic should begin at the same length to ensure similar durability and the amount of weight clamped onto the plastic should also be the same (and the weight must be recorded).
en_cw_000575	Conclusion: 3/5 plastic samples changed in size while one had no change and another decreased in size. The chart is awful. Defining the plastic samples used would be beneficial. Labeling the trials correctly would follow.
en_cw_000576	Plastic type B deformed the most, and plastic type A deformed the least. A and C are similar, B and D are similar in extension. The initial length of the material would be useful, and the amount of weight used. The weights could be varied, and the amount of time varied to investigate further.
en_cw_000577	It depends on what the plastic is. I can't determine what the conclusion is based on the data without additional information. The validity could be improved if the length of the plastic was given so we can tell what the beginning length was. Perhaps a shorter piece of plastic would stretch farther. During the second trial, why was there a disparity?
en_cw_000578	the plastic of UNA is more flexible because it had more stretch length. \n \n 1. use a press machinery on both ends of the plastic\n 2. apply more force to the stretch to the point of knowing what is the limit of each plastic
en_cw_000579	a. in trial T2 doesn't mean to have greater stretches for all samples\n b. could be hanging in same time all four samples
en_cw_000580	For samples A, B, and C it having done the experiment múltiple times affected how much the plástico elongates. Now, for a better experiment desing, he Should quote what type of plástico is using and how many weights is using, and if he is testing every plastic with the dame weights
en_cw_000584	what type of polymer plastics the student uses.
en_cw_000585	Conclusion: Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics.\n Improved the experiment:\n Provide the before and after measurements for length (Did the samples all start out the same size?).\n Make sure the samples are all of the same thickness. Variations in thickness could have caused variations in stretchability.
en_cw_000586	some of the types of plastic could be much thinner or pliable than others. The directions do not say anything about making sure that the plastic pieces were exactly the same length to start with. This could potentially skew the results of the experiment.
en_cw_000587	The conclusion is that the plastic is a moldable material
en_cw_000588	It makes no sense that D2 value in C is less than D1, so there must be something wrong with the data. The experiment should say how much should be the mass of the weights used in the experiment.
en_cw_000589	a) Al plastics elongated except D\n b) Use different weights to see if the data is consistent and make more samples, not only two
en_cw_000590	the experiment shows that different plastic materials are stretched differently by the same added weight. \n the plastic sample have to be securely clamped to the edge of the table rather than taping it
en_cw_000591	A conclusion would be that plastic can stretch when adding weight to one end.\n A way to improve the experiment would be to run the test on additional samples of each plastic piece used.\n This would make sure that it was not a fluke but could be repeated with the same results.\n Using tape at the top of the plastic sounds like it could not really be stabilized. The weights affecting the plastic could differ the results depending on how well the plastic was secured.

en_cw_000595	"in the opcion ""C"" D2 is most little"
en_cw_000596	a. Data obtained suggest that polymers B and D are the most stretchable, while C and A showed higher resistance to stretch during the 5 minutes of the experiment.\n b. First way: Increase the time of the experiment, as there is a chance that one plastic is actually more stretchable than another, but requires a a force to be applied for a longer period of time. Second way: perform additional trials with different weights, as some plastics could require heavier weights to test their stretchability.
en_cw_000597	For samples A and B he got more length difference. For the Samples C, D the amount streched was shorter and even the same for sample D. Here for he used two trials.
en_cw_000598	There is no length changed in plastic type D
en_cw_000599	Leave the weights a few more minutes.
en_cw_000600	a. On the second trial, the amount stretched of 3 from the plastic types were different from the first trial, making me question if the trial was indeed similar to the first one or if there was some external cause for that difference.\n \n b.

en_cw_000605	To determine the validity of the results, it had to standardize the weights to be used and specify them together with the other tools used in order to document all the information in the 2 tests.
en_cw_000606	1. adding more weight in such a way that it could also measure the resistance.\n 2.determining the type of plastic, there are plastics with different characteristics could have experimented with different types of plastics.
en_cw_000607	"a. There is contraction and expansion of plastic pieces after addition of considerable weight. Expansion is expected, but, contraction of plastic namely ""C"" needs to be analysed in further trails. \n \n b. Use of tape to attach one side of the plastic piece is not recommended, having a hook to suspend it is a better option.\n There is no mention of the plastic type used, which should be revealed from the start of the experiment."
en_cw_000608	The plastic material is really flexible. What makes it vulnerable to change it form. Exposing the plastic to the stress made by the weights, can change it length depending of the type of plastic used to the test. \n \n To get a better result, the student could change the way he measure the length changes, controling the temperature (what clearly have an effect on plastics), and using a the same weights and ruler to all the samples.
en_cw_000609	The data shows that Plastic B stretched the most being 22 mm T1 and 23 mm T2. The\n students could have made the experiment better if they did one more trial. Also, they could\n have been more specific in their procedure.
en_cw_000610	The stretchability of plastic encreases in order A, C, D, B and at least twice from A to B.\n Student can take tapes of different lengths ( the same for all plastics) and weights of different masses.
en_cw_000611	A sample of C is wrong
en_cw_000612	a, The four polymer plastics will be stretched by 10-23mm. The amount stretched in Plastic Type A and plastic Type C is similar and the amount stretched in Plastic Type B and plastic Type D is also similar.\n b. The weights added to the clamp should be of the same weight.\n Perform the trials for three more times and choose the median from the results to reduce errors.
en_cw_000613	1. It is necessary to measure the length of the plastic without removing the weight and clamp. 2. It is necessary to increase the time of the experiment and do the whole procedure within 10, 15 and 30 minutes

Polymer D is the only one to stretch exactly the same in both trials while polymer C is the only one that streched least in T2 when compared with T1. It would have been interesting to also test the polymers for different stretching times, and keep measuring them without removing the clamps to see how stretching evolved when compared with the time the clamps were hanging.

en_cw_000631	The purpose of the work was to establish patterns of change in tensile strain parameters of plastic blanks
en_cw_000632	The elasticity of each of the components is demonstrated by the experiment could be extended range by performing the experiment on a larger scale and for a longer period of time to observe a maximum of elasticity for each product
en_cw_000633	It is therefore concluded that the elasticity of the plastic depends on what is clamped at t he the bottom edge of the plastic.\n It is recommended that the students will have to use other plastic object to attach to the bottom edge of the plastic to measure its length.\n Also, they can let it hang for a longer time to make sure that the plastic have already set its weight.
en_cw_000634	a. Assuming that the starting length of the samples is equal plastic type B seems the type that has stretched the most without returning to its previous form.\n b. Assure that the starting length of the materials is the same. Measure the length of the material with the clamp and weights on it so you can measure the maximum stretchability before it returns to its original form.
en_cw_000635	a. It is hence concluded that it is not always necessary that length of plastic will increase on stretching.\n b. 1. By allowing them to hang longer.\n 2. By hanging them in different \n environmental conditions.
en_cw_000636	Apparently the material of sample 1 is the most eslastica, however the results are not reliable, because the student did not establish standard conditions for each sample, it does not specify if the dimensions of the samples were equal, nor if the weight used for get the deformation of the samples was the same for each experiment
