es_304SM51WA5HMIGOSEYW0KNAOLRRSBJ	a) All are even numbers and divisible by 2.nb) Order the table from smallest to largest.
es_30IQTZXKAMJTUA7HAS5YZEVXY9LX02	SAMPLES A AND B DO NOT RECOVER THE ORIGINAL LENGTH. SAMPLE C RECOVERS THE ORIGINAL LENGTH PARTIALLY. SAMPLE D RECOVERS ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH FULLY.
es_30JNVC0ORBXKWDC1MMHRBYYLOMTQHS	"a. The plastic type ""a"" demonstrated the most flexibility compared to the other plastics in the experiment. The student was able to try different types of weights and was able to leave the weighted clamp on the plastic for a longer period of time."
es_30JNVC0ORBXKWDC1MMHRBYYLQUHQHY	B is the most elastic of the four materials used in the test, he can use a pullie to test the tension.
es_30LSNF239W830PL0QT9BFS1XA0VI2G	a. The characteristics of the four plastics are different. Some are more elastic than others. \1) It is not clear how the first and second lengths were obtained. Was the plastic resting on a table or hanging when they were measured? And if they were measured differently, the length could have been affected by the weight of the plastic itself. The student had to clarify how they were measured, and the shape of the measurement had to be equal2) The weight of each plastic had to be equal since the weight of the plastic itself would affect the measurement. The experiment does not clarify whether the plastics had the same weight.
es_30MVJZJNHOQAVKQ5TK9Q1GOBXY29JD	A, the conclusion based on the student's data came out that the top performing plastic type is A.
es_30X31N5D653HZ6J08KW4PCQI19ISAY	The mass of a body measures the amount of matter it contains, while the weight measures the force with which the planet attracts that body.nnThe weight of a body is the force with which the planet attracts it. Its value is: F=m-g where g is the intensity of gravity, i.e., the force experienced by the unit of mass. nnThe mass always has the same value, while the weight depends on the value of g, which is not identical everywhere.
es_3137ONMDKIIHZERLTP49WHX6WCJEGO	ACCORDING TO THIS TABLE FOUR STUDENT FRAMES LIST BELOW THIS IS A, B, C, D. THE B STUDENT'S HIGHEST CREDIT POINT STORY IS B AND THE B STUDENT'S HIGHEST CREDIT POINT STORY AND EACH STUDENT HAS AN AVERAGE SCORE OF C AND D. THE STUDY CONTAINS A PLASTIC USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RESULT.
es_31IBVUNM9UCSNPHCDVN1E0LGYGBVFG	The data indicating the initial length of each of the plastic polymer samples are missing, with which one could compare the results of the first test (P1), now based on the results of the second test compared to those of the first, polymer A and B seem to be those that present a greater deformation and offer less resistance to the tensile force applied with the weights (A being the most plastic of the two), polymer C, contrary to the previous ones, seems to present elasticity since it contracted to a dimension even smaller than the one indicated in the first results, polymer D could be elastic, if it is assumed that after being subjected to the traction force with the weights in both tests, it recovered its original dimensions and did not suffer a permanent change in its structure.
es_31LM9EDVON5VKMUZUUSVJHJV391JND	plastic sticks more with static because 10 4% is more stable so the plastic sticks more
es_31Q0U3WYDRSZMKM8OY50JK1J1B371H	A) Based solely on the data presented, sample B is the most elastic. B) Since the elasticity of the material could be compromised after the first experiment, the second test should be done with a new sample of material, additionally the temperature of the sample should be controlled and standardized to be able to rule out this variable in the result.
es_31QTRG6Q2VQLIW1BW96QXT3EBTNYPR	Plastic B has more elasticity based on the data.  One way that could have been improved is to do another type of activity to determine elasticity.  The second test should have been another type of demonstration.
es_31QTRG6Q2VQLIW1BW96QXT3ECMJYPA	a. Plastic type B is the most elastic. b. The student could have improved the design of the experiment by doing more trials (P1, P2, P3, P4, ect). In addition, he could measure the initial length and the final length three times and calculate the average of these numbers to be more accurate.
es_31T4R4OBOUTJ9NW64VUK0GKADAO7CD	a. 3 of the 4 types of plastics are stretched. nb. using the same weights for all plastics and using plastics of the same size.
es_31T4R4OBOUTJ9NW64VUK0GKAGW6C7B	As the experiment shows in each polymer, but as you can see polymer D is the only one in which it does not affect any length unlike the others, you could change the length by applying a little more weight so that there is a change in length.
es_324G5B4FB5LZFV1QSF105FI9X3D70Z	a. The most elastic polymer is B, followed by D, C, and A. The student could have performed more tests with each type of polymer, since the number of data we have is small (only two samples). In addition, it would be convenient to test all four polymers at the same time, so that the experimental conditions would be the same in all replicates.
es_32M8BPYGAVZTFJT7P8U0HWVYHP5GIB	Conclusion: Materials (Polymers) B and D present a higher elasticity according to the table shown. \The student could improve his experiment if he applied different weights to the hanging end, in order to establish a more precise table of elasticity of the material according to the weight or force applied.
es_32SCWG5HIJHJZCR5QQBYE2JLCFAP6Q	My conclusion is that this experiment is not valid to know the elasticity of the samples, because after removing the weights, we don't know when that sample retracts. You can measure the samples with the weights on.
es_32UTUBMZ7I92A85W8T15VAUVB3TBVM	a) The ascending order in the elasticity of the plastics is A < C < D < B. You could have improved the experiment by performing the test more times to make sure that the result is consistent. You should also take the temperature of the plastics at the time of measurement, as it affects the elasticity of the plastics.
es_32VNZTT0A9HQW236KUM8MZZMHAWR4B	a.The four different types of plastics definitely show different levels of elasticity, but we cannot be sure that these different levels of deformation are caused by force alone; because one of the samples actually decreased in size rather than increasing as the others did.\You could have tried using materials that had the same initial sizes. You could have tried to identify other factors that might have affected the dimensions (e.g., in this experiment the temperature changes, perhaps causing these materials to expand or contract, so you might consider repeating the experiment inside a temperature-controlled room).
es_32XVDSJFP1APW8BRB8737L8EWWPM2P	put more details and drawings
es_32ZKVD547H0IYZ3DOJVZCF2CJINB39	The plastic sample seems to have expanded more with the second experiment. The student could have made a better table of the results in order to understand it better.
es_33C7UALJVNB3MYRRY3X6XKXEKDR81V	Plastic expands according to conditions and temperature.
es_33C7UALJVNB3MYRRY3X6XKXEMGH18M	a. According to the results obtained in the experiment the plastic material B obtained greater length with respect to the other materials used in the experiment. nnb. The samples of the plastic materials have to have the same dimensions with respect to the (length and thickness).nnc. In the procedure it was possible to add another test in order to get an average and get a more accurate result.
es_33F859I568QXS7AC34K1G93M3K3BH9	a) After the process P1, the plastics have been stretched enough, in relation to the weight added. In P2 as the plastics have already been stretched with the weight used in P1, the length gained is not very large, as can be observed in A and B.\In the case of C presents a loss of length which would indicate that it is a plastic with specific properties, (it is closer to the rubber). In the case of D there is no gain, it is a very moldable plastic.
es_33FOTY3KEOY5Y1H4FFDBZ6TX3HZ1C0	Plastic A has the least elasticity, the more it stretches the more elastic it is. I would measure the elasticity with the weight and the clamp. Another way to measure the elasticity is to pull the plastic from opposite sides and see how much it is able to stretch without breaking.
es_33IZTU6J83ETVJRTJUOI9K1G1GRSX9	a. Polymer B has gained more length, polymer D has gained a little less. Polymer C has gained even less, and polymer A has gained the least of all. B is the most ductile of all, and A is the least ductile. nb. One way to improve the validity of the results is simply to add more tests; two tests are not enough to eliminate statistical fluctuations. In general, it can be said that the more tests, the more accurate the results. The other way to improve the design of the experiment is to specify the initial lengths of the plastic polymers, in order to see how much they have gained in percentage.
es_33JKGHPFYE7LLU0KXR5NZ9BC5X4NMF	It can be concluded that the student obtained similar data in the two tests. The student can improve the design of the experiment by doing one more test.
es_33L7PJKHCIB4VI300MHG3QG9628T8L	I think there is a mistake with plastic C. Maybe the student can use a magnet and an electric current to release all of the weights at the same time.
es_33LK57MYLVII0ER8KCC365HR3PLZSL	a. Plastic D takes longer and is the worst. Must have more plastic samples to see better results.
es_33M4IA01QIEHU4RG45ODJAWKCZXRXC	a. Plastic B has the highest elasticity. Then the D, then the C and finally the A is the one with the lowest elasticity. To extend the results you can:1) Do the same test under different temperatures, for example one at night, one in the daytime under a roof and one in the daytime under the sun. This way you can see if the external temperature affects the elasticity. \n(2) You can also vary the weight applied to the sample, so you can see if the higher the force, the different plastics respond differently with respect to their elasticity.
es_33SA9F9TRZ7DW0HL8U8RIKJURV9WEW	I could make another preba to have 3 prebas of the experiment.
es_33TIN5LC06N0Q9L4FKATB33ZE8OY9P	The student could have used a clamp to secure the plastic at the top. The student should use a new sample of the same material in the second experiment.
es_340UGXU9D0EH67E28KI000MJ65EUV4	a. Plastic D is the one that gained more length than the other plastics. Plastic B is the second longest of the four plastics, plastic C the third longest, and plastic A gained the least amount of length. The student could have done more tests, and also could have done the experiment with more types of plastics.
es_34J10VATJHBKS8NLS4ZCBAZ0Q4AIQR	Plastic D is the most resistant to the counterweight. Plastic A is the least resistant, followed by plastic B. Plastic C retracted in length with the counterweight instead of increasing in length.
es_34Q075JO1ZQL49MO3ZKR45RWWWC10R	Firstly, whether where each of the samples of the four polymers was hung was level, or had a certain inclination. \Secondly, if the samples were hung in the shade or in the sun, because in addition to the weight of the bottom of each of them, the sun can influence the stretching of the samples in heating the plastic.
es_34V1S5K3GUEY7PBY91F1SCJ64I9967	In conclusion, this experiment shows us how much deformity is generated within the different types of plastics when subjected to a given weight for 5 minutes, in the first two cases it can be noted that 1 centimeter was gained. While in the last two cases the first one decreased one centimeter and the other remained the same. \The student could use clamps on both sides of the table, and it is not necessary to remove the clamps from the plastics.
es_34X6J5FLPVBGNJ7RAMKCNBE049LQJE	(A). plastics A and B are lengthened, while C is reduced by 1 mm and D remains exactly as before (B).
es_352YTHGROXQD78P3OPAE8VXGRVOH4F	Decreasing order according to elasticity: B, D, C, AI assume that the hanging weight was left to each polymer in equal amount of time and that all polymers start with the same initial distance, that the table only shows the length differential. I would have repeated the experiment more times, to take an average value of their length.
es_3570Y55XZRWF5J8CTQG33KPM7X5GYX	"Plolymer A appears to be the most elastic of all and B to a lesser extent. Polymer C, appears to have recovered some of its initial length, and D reached its maximum elasticity. I would look to test all four samples at the same time, for a longer time, before measuring the length. Wait about 30 minutes with the samples ""at rest"" and remeasure to determine recovery. I would repeat the experiment at least 2 times."
es_358010RM5G69NB8XDPTNK7LN1FEXV3	a. Polymers A and B have one level of elasticity, polymers C and D are not elastic.nb. Use new samples of plastics in a third experiment and change the weight added to the clamps.
es_358010RM5G69NB8XDPTNK7LN2K7VX5	a. Plastic B is the most elastic of the four samples. nb. 1- Measure the length before removing the weight, and more than twice. n 2- Find out if waiting five minutes is enough time.
es_358UUM7WR1GNFPLPMSKFPBJW64DR74	a. Depending on the type of plastic, the elasticity of polymers can increase from 10 to 20 mm. The student could have repeated the experiment, doing more tests (P3, P4, P5, etc.), to improve the validity of his conclusions. He could also have marked the exact location where he hooked the clamp on each plastic sample, to make sure that the positioning does not affect the results.
es_358UUM7WR1GNFPLPMSKFPBJW91NR7B	The table shows that C is the only one that decreases comparing p1 and p2 , the design could be improved with a more graphical table.
es_35BLDD71I8AYS68CE7H8HS1Y07IZVJ	Plastics A and B are more elastic in the second test than in the first. The opposite happens with plastic C, plastic D always behaves the same.  Plastics B and D are more elastic than the rest. Using the same temperature is always a way to improve the experiment.
es_35BLDD71I8AYS68CE7H8HS1Y7NWVZW	The polymer with the highest elasticity is B based on the distance reached in millimeters. The experiment would be improved if the specific name of each plastic used could be included and if the weight value used (aggregate) in grams was included. I would also use two different amounts of weight (grams) for each measurement to determine if each polymer remains flexible or breaks with increasing weight.
es_35GCEFQ6I71EGX6TUXB2YX9FJ2O3ZT	a. Sample D is the most resistant to physical change;nb. It could increase the number of tests, thus increasing statistical sampling and improving its experimental certainty. In addition, the experimental method can be improved as the act of attaching weights to the sample inserts uncertainty into the experiment.
es_35H6S234SCDF629M6B2KGWE4IFI56Q	polymers are long chains made up of many small chemical units, and that chain length plays a vital role in determining behavior and physical properties
es_35K3O9HUADQBLEVQI5YREWXUV7QEFG	a. P2 is better. \nb. Two ways in which the student could have improved is by raising C and raising D.
es_35LDD5557CHKDOFH0ED77HU854LMKT	a)Based on the data it can be concluded that plastic B has a higher elasticity followed by plastic D. With lower elasticity are plastic C followed by A. b)-To improve the experiment the student can increase the number of tests performed to make the results more reliable. information about the plastic samples and the amount of weight (F =ma) being applied to each should be added.
es_35LDD5557CHKDOFH0ED77HU88D9MK2	a. There are several factors that have not been identical for both cases or the polymer measurements were not exactly the same. It may also be that there is a margin of error in the length calculation. Describe how much each plastic measures before and after. Describe the qualities of each type of plastic. Establish a margin of error in measurement.
es_369J354OFFNDMZY6N7LBKT5TE87G64	We can use the strain gauge instead of using weights on the clamps. We can also use physical force by measuring a certain distance (mm) and calculating the time.
es_36AHBNMV1TPCTZYLR0FVXZMP5Z1DYV	Most plastics are the same, so the experiment did not give much relevant data to make a complete study.
es_36AHBNMV1TPCTZYLR0FVXZMPUL4DYV	a) The most elastic type of plastic is B, as it has gained the most length in the two tests. The least elastic is A. b) First, you should include the weights you have added to the clamp, and it should be the same weight throughout the experiment (i.e., apply the same weight all the time). Second, all the plastic pieces should have the same initial length, since it would make sense that the length gained would depend not only on the elasticity of the material, but also on the initial length.
es_36H9ULYP647JWUHIW69IBCAMUY5FJH	a.: When repeating the same tests, it was observed that there was no significant variation in the results obtained at the end of both tests, reaching the conclusion that the same element when exposed to the same conditions tends to repeat with a slight deviation the same behavior. b.:1) Increase the number of tests to obtain a more accurate result to the real behavior of the plastics in question. 2) Perform the experiment and/or tests in a controlled environment. Since external conditions can affect the result of the experiment, this can be seen in the slight deviation of the tabulated results.
es_36PW28KO419GPNEI7PCZ0VM3WBREAJ	a) Plastic B is the one that acquires the greatest length. b) A second time sample could have been included to see if the result changes with more time.
es_36U2A8VAG3CK754VJH1I1CHFG04YKA	The validity of the tests lies in the unduplicated results, I would have done a third test in order to determine the elasticity of the polymer with the same weight and the same time.
es_36ZN444YTTBH7WA5DR78M540CLCIO4	a. Two tests are insufficient to draw a conclusion beyond averaging the length gained in both tests. Put the weights and clamp on at the same time to have less variation e.g. in ambient temperature. Perform more than two tests.
es_374TNBHA8D86I82QWMLFXYTOEUZYQG	From the result of the experiment it can be deduced that Polymer B has the higher elasticity than the rest. The experiment can be improved by for example:\n1.- Exposing the polymers to different temperatures.\n2.- Subjecting the polymer to constant pressure with some press and check if the elasticity is higher than with the weight tests.
es_37Q970SNZGLL5I60C13BEBXFOUF1S7	A.plastic D is the most stable. calculate the weight of the plastic, and the time the test lasted.
es_37QW5D2ZRIZ3GIQLBMCQTLKNAK98SY	a) As the elasticity is being tested, the polymer that proved to be more elastic is B, then D, C and finally A, from greater to lesser elasticity nnb) In order to improve the experiment is to make a third reproduction to get a more accurate standard deviation and know what is the variation of the reproduction of the experiment.
es_37TD41K0AJM5SLGYSYSVV7G6245CS7	Conclusion: The student does not understand the concept of elasticity.nImprovements/Remarks:n1. Measure time and ability of the plastic to recover to its original dimensions.n2. Perform more tests, as necessary to make the sample useful for drawing any conclusions.
es_37TD41K0AJM5SLGYSYSVV7G6SN5CSZ	According to the results, the most elastic polymers in decreasing order are samples b,d,c,a. Another method of doing the elasticity test is to subject the samples to a flexural test. In this test, one places each specimen in a horizontal manner and places supports under both edges near the corners similar to a typical bridge. Exactly over the middle of the polymer a weight is placed and then it should be measured how much the sample deflected vertically in the center. This deflection will be measured using a ruler in millimeters. A second way to further validate the results is to do more tests and get more results for each polymer and do an error proofing analysis to see which tests have more errors and discard them and only consider the tests with less errors.
es_37U1UTWH9XZRF3Q8WXCL3BFRIO4R8D	The procedure is correct. All that remains is to average the two tests.
es_37UEWGM5HVL9436NXC36O1SJ2VIR11	The initial size must be entered.
es_37Z929RLGBLME2I9EKNLKHGAH6ITS7	Everything was great, but I could make a better picture.
es_384PI804XUELYTLIGIZB06E5U0M0SN	The most elastic polymer is B, followed by D, C and A. They also have different behaviors in the second test. While polymer D remains unchanged, polymer A stretches 2 mm, polymer B 1 mm and polymer C curiously shortens 1 mm instead of lengthening. nTwo ways to improve the design of the experiment could be to:n-Do a third test-Double the stress time of the tests.nThis alone multiplies the data obtained in order to obtain more information.
es_386CSBG1O1Z4ZOSKQ3QNE79VEAKQ61	a. Plastic type A was the most elastic of the four plastic polymers tested, the stretch seen in this type of plastic was less than that seen in type C, the second most elastic. Plastic type B was the least elastic, it had stretched more than 22 mm in both replicates, more even than plastic D which stretched 20 mm in both experiments. The students could have improved the experimental design by varying the weight of each type of plastic. The students could also have rotated each type of plastic between repeated experiments to ensure that the orientation would not affect the results.
es_386PBUZZXHA5WMREIHCG6PF60NALJ6	a. Samples A and B are longer at the endSample C is shorterSample D is unchangedb. The experiment can have more information about the times of the experiment.
es_38BQUHLA9YD33F0WY650EYBHPAPOMB	The conclusion I draw is that in both tests the plastic has gained length and that plastic A is similar to C, and that B is similar to D. To improve the experiment, in the data table I would have added the length of each plastic and the weight of each weight.
es_38BQUHLA9YD33F0WY650EYBHRI4MO6	Tension to certain types of plastics increases their length. It could have been certified that all experiments were performed at a specific temperature for all types of plastics.
es_38F5OAUN5PPAQV7MQN8LB7HQL3Y7HO	The students are much more tired on p2, so it is more difficult. If the students had been less tired, he would have had an easier donation to give them sugar. You can also make jokes to wake them up a bit.
es_38F5OAUN5PPAQV7MQN8LB7HQNJSH7Q	A. Plastics B and D have stretched the greatest length which shows that they are the most elastic. Plastics A and C have stretched the most. The student could have improved the experiment and the validity of the results by repeating the test many more times, also he should have used different samples of the different plastics to make sure that the samples used do not have any defects.
es_38F5OAUN5PPAQV7MQN8LB7HQSA5H7Q	The conclusion is that the plastic deformation is similar in P1 and P2 although there is some variation. It should be known when the P1 and P2 experiments were done, whether on the same day, or on different days at different temperature conditions etc.nnOne way the student could have improved the design is to do more than two tests to corroborate the data better. He could also have done both experiments at the same time to exclude any variation due to environmental conditions.
es_38JBBYETQQN1NYY1YO28NS03ZG84E0	He could have used the same length for the different plastics to start with, and used new ones with the same length in test two.
es_38JBBYETQQN1NYY1YO28NS03ZSI4EY	in the table of values the student should have placed the values of the, and have taken into account the types of plastic to know their density, the experiment shows that plastic D did not suffer a change in length due to weight, plastic C reduced its length, and plastics A and B slightly increased their length.
es_38SKSKU7R3A91B780ZRGUO06EX6LIK	the p2 plastic is a little bit not so strong so it is recommended to test it with a trandlucid plastic and see how it behaves on it so if the whole experiment could be successful or it could go well.
es_38SKSKU7R3A91B780ZRGUO06FLWLIN	The plastic used in P1 elongated in samples A, B, and C. And in sample D it did not elongate. The student was able to improve the experiment by adding more weight to the plastic without the need to change it.
es_3907X2AHF2IVHB843OZVOP29UAVP2U	Depending on the type of polymer, it can be used for incredible things, it is a resistant material and it is also not very accessible.
es_39GAF6DQWTD1XAN46W8GPYHMQI6V1A	a) The type of plastic that stretched the most was type A, however it is not specified if the amount of weight used was the same for all types of plastic. b) I think that the experiment could be improved by doing more tests to confirm the results and not just two tests.
es_39GXDJN2OVRJ8A7P5HHV484U175V8M	Plastics used in this test have different reactions to heat. The one that resists deformation best is plastic A. B is the worst. This tank needs defined temperatures. Also, the original length of the plastics.
es_39JEC7537WELKDX2MTX06U0D0B2VC3	"A. The student has noticed that plastic ""D"" is stronger than the others. nB. The student should form a hypothesis so that the experiment has a clear foundation. In addition, new pieces of plastic should be incorporated for the next tests. There should be more than two. Only two trials lack a foundation."
es_39K0FND3AJSE1B6VON0ID3RC0SYMAL	All plastics gained a few mm in length, i.e., a weight hung for 5 minutes can lengthen different types of plastics. The student could have improved the experiment by adding other heavier elements to the same types of plastics and by trying different times. Add a field of 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour in this way we will see how the plastics behave with the same weight but with different times.
es_39K0FND3AJSE1B6VON0ID3RC1DAAMS	a.Plastic materials elongate variably when subjected to a constant vertical force. I would have added more repetitions with the same weight and performed another experiment by varying the weight of the clamps.
es_39L1G8WVWS4HL1LLMM2A63P368S13P	A )It seems that the experiment gives reasonable results. In both tests the results are quite similar. nB) You could do more tests and take the average lengths.
es_39L1G8WVWS4HL1LLMM2A63P3W8B13Y	Conclusion: since the stress exerted is the same in all cases, it can be said that the coefficient of elasticity of A>C>D>B.\To improve the experiment, the student could have placed a ruler parallel to the material during the stress to compare the increase in length of the plastics with the stress applied instead of the deformation after removing the weights and another improvement of the experiment could be to measure the length of the plastic samples before removing the weights or taking into account the time to wait after removing the weights to measure all the plastics at the same rest.
es_39N5ACM9HG06HVT3OXEAYCAN25K9P1	Plastic B is the most elastic plastic. Do more than 2 tests for best results and use different clamps.
es_39N5ACM9HG06HVT3OXEAYCAN2SXP94	The plastic that deforms the least is type A, followed by type C, type D and finally type B. The plastic that showed the most deformation was type B. The type C plastic recorded less length after the P2 test compared to the P1 test which could indicate a measurement error. The design could have been improved if the student had taken the initial measurement of each type of plastic and reported the length that the plastic gained in terms of percentage with respect to the initial length. Another improvement in the design could be to use different weights for tests P1 and P2.
es_39PAAFCODOD26UZD8FSQV40HF96VT5	At first glance it seems that plastic B is the most elastic, because it is the one that has gained the most length in both experiments. However, what should be measured is the relative increase in length, i.e. the ratio between what was stretched and the original length. Because at no time is it said that all the polymers used had the same initial length. Nor does it say what happens after the weights are removed, i.e. whether the sample returns to its original length or whether it is stretched. We do not know if the second experiment was done after the polymers returned to their initial shape or not. If the weights are excessive, the polymers may be permanently deformed, and we would no longer be measuring elasticity, which has to do with the ability of the material to return to its original shape after stretching. I would then progressively increase the weights, always checking that the polymers can return to their original shape after removal, to make sure that they have not been deformed by excessive loading. The experiment would be limited by the maximum weight that the least elastic polymer could support, comparing the lengths of all the polymers with this weight. Or the most elastic one could be found after eliminating the other three by permanent deformation with increasing weights.
es_39RP059MEJ6JKLBNU10E8EBIKU1BMT	a. Most of the plastic types (A, B and C) suffer an appreciable deformation after 5 minutes of being subjected to a stretching work. Perform the same test, but now taking into account the weight to which the samples are subjected: e.g. test with 0.5kg, 1kg and 1.5kg. \nPerform the same test, now subjecting the plastic samples to longer stretching times and record the results for 10, 15 and 20 minutes.
es_39RP059MEJ6JKLBNU10E8EBIPYCMBS	a. Since the results of P1 and P2 were not exactly the same, it appears that some factor of the experiment was not properly measured or reported for this experiment. 1) Include the exact length of the plastic at the time of the start. 2) Include the air temperature during the experiment.
es_39ZSFO5CAA98FCE8RV4HXCBP52DUJN	based on the results for both tests i can see that it has gained length in the plastics but can't see exactly how much because we don't have an initial measurement maybe in both tests the same plastics average different. to improve the experiment i would add the exact weight instead of the length gained and not remove the weights to measure it maybe removing the length decreases.
es_39ZSFO5CAA98FCE8RV4HXCBPA0RUJ2	Plastics A and B increased in length in the second test. Plastic C did not increase in length. Plastic D did not change in the second test. It would have been better to use different types of plastics and methods.
es_3A0EX8ZRNA1JE201D4OP29YPULRBYU	A. Plastium is very elastic. That's why so many millimeters could be gained in the experiment 5 minutes at a time. The plastic could have been bent with itself. This might have helped the plastic not to be so elastic.
es_3A7Y0R2P2Q10WG83W0F4HJAT6N3XJ4	a.- Material D does not deform with that weight after 5 min. nb. - The deformation scale should be marked on a vertical flat surface. The test should be completed with different weights and different exposure times. The temperature of the ambient test and of the specimen should be noted.
es_3A9AA95ATYZNG8RRL71TMW5LGJZ5PO	My conclusion is that plastic B is the most elastic.  \I think you could improve your research by simply doing more tests. That would give more information to analyze. Also, you could have stretched the plastics in another more manageable way.
es_3AAPLD8UCEUXOT4T3QBMG398F77HTB	The plastic material is undoubtedly a very elastic polymer in which it alters at the moment of placing weight on it, taking the data of each test in the difference chart it could be noticed that there is little difference but the material D had a relevant way to remain the same length there was no alteration.nThe result would have varied with a little more weight so that the material would notice its resistance and length in each of the tests.
es_3AQF3RZ55AV78Z2BCNFT285HCA76FS	It is not known what kind of plastic was used. And what glue was used for the procedure. How much weight was used for each type of plastic. A camera could have been used to determine the exact results of the types of plastics.
es_3ATTHHXXWC1415OXEIU45IVTL7TXIX	a. Different types of plastics have different elasticity. Note the initial length of the plastics used, note the weight of the weights used.
es_3AUQQEL7U761QL2MAD4GBTYCNLM0VQ	According to the results, plastic sample A had greater elasticity. To improve the experiment, the ambient temperature should be taken into account, since the material is sensitive to heat and may affect the results.
es_3AUQQEL7U761QL2MAD4GBTYCSHLV0H	The length gained by the different types of plastic varies quite a bit.nIt is not known if the plastics used for the second test are new or if they are the same as in the first test.nIt is also not known if the different types of plastics measure the same before starting the tests, since gaining 10mm if it measured 10mm before adding the weight, is more than gaining 23mm if it measured 1m.
es_3AZHRG4CU6XHEC03Q3YASY6TV8L301	a. The plastic is expandable, and its final length depends on the type of plastic. b. The student could have also measured the width of the plastic before and after. The student could also have measured the width of the plastic before and after. In addition, he could have measured the weight of each piece of plastic for better accuracy.

es_3B3WTRP3DDFAPOSXMZ3Y2Z2UP8692G	a. Plastic B is the most elastic by testing the data. I should have done at least one more P3 test, and taken mean values as a conclusion to the experiment.
es_3B3WTRP3DDFAPOSXMZ3Y2Z2URHJ92D	Polymer B is the one that gains the most length.To improve it, the student could have mentioned by name, the type of polymers he used and could have pointed out the time distance in which he performed the two tests.
es_3B837J3LDQ99YN5HAVIQK2FSSMKSRT	polymers a and b stretch with an external force, c shrinks and d is inelastic and therefore maintains its length. The ways to improve the experiment are: first measuring the polymers in the intermediate stage with the tension coming from the weight and second applying different amounts of weight to them.
es_3BDCF01OGZ7VRBMD4HDJGCUU768LYD	The conclusion of this experiment, according to the results shown above, is that plastic type A is the least elastic, since between P1 and P2 it has increased its size by 2 mm. Plastic type B is better than type A, because it has only increased by 1mm, but the best of the four is type C, since it recovers the size of P1 and even reduces by 1mm, followed by type D, which remains the same between P1 and P2. The problem with this experiment is that it does not tell us the initial size of the different types of plastic, so we do not know exactly the results of P1.
es_3BEFOD78W86ZZMQEFMQR005C8H6M4C	Plastic A has gained more length. For a better result the student should use new plastics instead of doing the second test with the same plastics.  Leaving the plastics hanging is not a good idea, because the plastic may return to its original shape.
es_3BEFOD78W86ZZMQEFMQR005C8HNM4T	In principle, it does not indicate how much time passed between P1 and P2. Therefore, we do not really know if, if more time passed, each plastic would have returned to its natural state. On the other hand, we do not know well the measurements with which each plastic started. It would have been more useful to add the initial measurements, the measurements after 5 minutes, the measurement after 1 hour, and finally the difference (or how much it has gained in mm) after the 5 minutes and after the hour.
es_3C2NJ6JBKCUVEQWRN9M3K0XET3CN2T	Plastic D is reliable since it has the same elasticity in both experiments. To improve the experiment, the student should state the types of plastics and also state more control conditions. For example: what kind of weights were used and the temperature of the environment.
es_3C8HJ7UOP97F2JE30FGHUWIL9CMZME	Based on the results, Plastic D has the most constant elasticity which means it is reliable. The student has to state the type of plastic and also has to state the conditions of the place where the experiment was performed. It should be in a temperature controlled environment.
es_3CCZ6YKWR9W2OLBK4I5W06568EF59M	a. Plastic B deforms the most under the action of a force, followed by plastic D and C. Plastic A deforms the least. Repeat the experiment more times to be able to reduce the margin of error. It would be necessary to measure if each plastic recovers its original size once the force that deforms it ceases, in order to determine the elasticity.
es_3CN4LGXD5Z1ZT3FSYPE2UVSJHT8Y46	The results of test C do not make sense. At most the plastic should retain its original length when a weight is applied to one end, but never shrink. To improve the design of the experiment, the student should have included a sketch of the experiment. In addition, he should have detailed the dimensions of the plastic to be used in the experiment.
es_3COPXFW7XDPQYRCUSU5ZOLO3BB9KP5	a) Of all the existing types of plastics, the one with the highest elasticity was plastic type A due to the increase of 2mm, polymer types B and C had only 1mm of elasticity and polymer type D had no results. b) Could have subjected more weight for more time to the polymers; or the same weight for more time to the polymers. Can confirm the length of the polymers one hour after stretching with the weights in order to evaluate whether the polymer reduced its size.
es_3CP1TO84PVERO1QLJ9QHQJXSB8B256	The polymer samples were probably not under the same weight during the tests, another factor could have been the ambient temperature, which is why the results were so diverse.
es_3CTOC39K3936H12CENB6NKX52WS7JP	The student could have indicated how much weight he added to the plastics, and also how much the plastics measured before attaching the weight.
es_3D3VGR7TA2S5E6K2KGHPCU7G0AXR3K	The conclusion of the experiment shows that plastic type A, B and C have similar elasticity. While plastic D has not undergone any change.To improve the results he could have involved the end table. Also, he could have said what kind of weights he used in the different tests to better understand what the elasticity of the material depended on.
es_3D4CH1LGEC604I04LEON43WV7ET9GZ	draws a conclusion based on the student's data both ways
es_3DBQWDE4Y8BNDNFE5SO1I70QJVZN5W	THE RESULT IS PLASTIC 2. WHY DOES IT HAVE A MAJORITY mm
es_3DQQ64TANIYHTR6BH8O2CWIY63RWP0	a. Plastics B and D are the most flexible of the group while plastics A and C are the most resistant to deformation.nb. The student could improve the validity of the results by including the initial length of the plastic samples and the value of the weights used in the data table so that it is possible to corroborate the experiment with the corresponding equations.
es_3DUZQ9U6SO11RUMYJFN0LZ4VDQJVS7	a. Type A plastic is the most flexible and in both tests. Students should have used an accurate weight for all types of plastics for tests P1 and P2 and measure the initial length and final length for both types of plastics in all tests.
es_3DY4FPOOA31PQFML4QNVVPZZRR4VRT	The elasticity of polymers A, B and C show some difference between the two tests, and polymer D showed a constant elasticity. The polymer with the highest elasticity is B. The experiment could be improved in the table by noting the initial measurements of each polymer.
es_3E1QT0TDFRMEM4NP6AICPJE0UT08I6	Based on the data, Plastic 'B' exhibits the greatest amount of elasticity. The student can improve their results better by applying a weight instead of a clamp. They can also improve the design by measuring each plastic at the same time.
es_3E47SOBEYS9GY7D2NMYHR5AJJLDCI9	Conclusion: Plastic B proved to be the most expandable, and plastic A the least expandable in both tests. I consider that the ideal would have been to perform the experiment at the same time with the 4 types of plastic, all carrying the same weight. This way it would have been easier to identify which plastic is the most expandable, and which is the least expandable. In a single test. Greetings.
es_3E4GGUZ1TA4U6KBOQWUNS8GAZ6MK2W	It is concluded that: Plastic A is more expandable, and plastic D is the least expandable. I believe that this experiment would be more complete if all the plastics were given the same weight at the same time, so that the level of elasticity of each plastic could be identified much better, and in a single test. Greetings!
es_3EA3QWIZ4K8XKOFD98T7GFANCHBTIW	Do a second test, exactly like test P2, ending like the first test.
es_3EICBYG6469CTIX854JH36PJW3WCJL	that with the plastic and the clamp there is better length
es_3EJJQNKU9TIK8ER1Z16RGO8QJC3RH9	b. sample (D) will be the best due to the fact that the premiere and the second test yielded the same result
es_3EO896NRAY8TFZZJRQE7SGPNK47JTG	a. Plastic type A is the most flexible. Interestingly, the plastic type C, reduced in size after the experiment. It is better to design the experiment with the plastic hanging from the ceiling, rather than hanging from the side of a table. You could also extend the time of the experiment (more than 5 minutes) or try the experiment several times and calculate the average of all the results.
es_3ERET4BTVOM564WNB5922VOOBWCK9E	THE RESULT IS PLASTIC 2. WHY DOES IT HAVE A MAJORITY mm
es_3F0BG9B9MR0WCQXB0NC9X7CT8ZP7YY	Of four types of plastic, two of them have increased in length, one has decreased (which is hard to imagine) and one has remained the same. The gluing at the edge of the table makes the sample invalid because he has hardly glued the 4 types of plastic in the same way so he could have hooked it to two stress points and applied the same force at both ends with mechanical elements with equal load power.
es_3F6HPJW4JFDL1K55FADQGJA5M772WA	WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT PLASTIC A GAINED 2 MM IN LENGTH BETWEEN TEST 1 AND 2, WHILE B AND C GAINED 1 MM ONLY AND D REMAINED THE SAME LENGTH, WE CAN NOTICE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PLASTICS WAS DIFFERENT, MAYBE IF THE STUDENT WOULD SHOW US THE CONSTRUCTION OF EACH SUBJET WE COULD REACH A BETTER CONCLUSION. HE COULD ALSO HAVE PLAYED WITH DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES, FOR EXAMPLE, HE COULD HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL P3 WITH THE SAME TIME AND WEIGHT BUT UNDER THE SUN.
es_3F6KKYWMNDEIH0U7KY6KGJOIZ1LDNZ	I conclude that polymer D is the most elastic of the 4 because it returns to its initial size. To improve the experiment I would include the measurement of the plastic while it is subjected to the weight, to see if it stretches and if it returns to its initial size, which is what really determines its elasticity.
es_3FFJ6VRIL31W4FIMB65XW48IA390IB	The plastics gained length thanks to the added weight, the student could have let the plastic hang from a cable and clarified the density of the plastic.
es_3FK0YFF9P1THJM32DAS5WMO2HTOVVQ	a) plastic D has the most consistent length change of the 4. b) You should have made sure that all 4 samples were identical in length, or calculated the length gained vs. the initial length, also you should have specified the weight of the weights, AND measured the elasticity while the weights were hanging since now you have not measured elasticity but increase in length after being subjected to weight.
es_3FQ5JJ512N1QV60HCFS7KWJ8ERDNKA	a. The type B plastic is the most elastic of all. b. They could have applied an external heat source which would make the plastic more malleable and easier to stretch.
es_3FTF2T8WLTVW14Q40JS5Q6IJV4EW9E	a. Plastic B is the most elastic of the samples and plastic A is the least elastic. 1 add different weights to the different plastics. 2 attach the weights to each limb and do not just rely on gravity.
es_3G0WWMR1UXXC69YCPKC4GIVH9DANQZ	a. According to the data, materials B and D possess higher elasticity, so they had a higher alogamnt than materials A and C. More measurements could be made and at the end an average should be plotted, making the results more accurate.
es_3G2UL9A02FRUT6N5U4HHEGS0ECY67E	ACCORDING TO THE TABLE, THE FOUR GROUPS HAVE PARTICIPATED THE PLASTIC GAIN AND THE RESULT SHOULD BE B OF THE HIGHEST SCORE OF THE 45 AND THE LARGEST SCORE OF A IS 22 SO ANOTHER C AND D IS THE MEASURE OF THE TABLE.
es_3G5F9DBFORAC1L8I8LB1HLXTBYYVHR	The conclusion is that the plastic is moldable, and resistant to breakage, you can design the best possible expirement by screening the main and final size instead of just the increments.
es_3GDTJDAPVWO0INDGRPG4HCLHAMEM8X	Based on the explanation of the experiment and the results, I think the test was very good. What I would recommend to improve and to be able to see even more the changes between the different types of plastic, is to put even more weight on them and at an even higher height. At the same time, leave them for a longer period of time to really notice the change. Although knowing that all of them will have a length limit.
es_3GFK2QRXXBUD0HOSXTFOEQDHHMY5WZ	a. As shown in the table, plastic B has a higher elasticity than the other plastics and plastic A has the lowest elasticity. nb. The table would be more complete and clearer if the initial lengths of the plastic and the lengths of the plastic after adding the weights were added.
es_3GNA64GUZGH8GKS6LKGIM1VVPMI5QU	Plastic D has a higher elasticity and is the only one that has been consistent in measurement (mm). Ways to improve the experiment, 1. Measure the plastics before and after to see the % growth (elasticity) over the normal size. 2. Use a larger sample and calculate averages of them.
es_3GNCZX450K0KME38G3SAU7L76KFAPM	a. Plastic B is the longer plastic while plastic A is the shorter one. Although the data is not precise it is very credible because there is not much difference between the two tests. \nb. Be sure to put the clamp in the same location on all 4 plastics. And run the test at least 2 more times to make sure the data comes out credible all 4 times.
es_3GU1KF0O4KEP5O80MHS6PI5DOHIBPU	a) some plastics expanded, others decreased and one maintained size b) the second test should be on an identical initial sample, and not on the result of p1.
es_3GU1KF0O4KEP5O80MHS6PI5DSSOPB4	a. Plastic B is the most elastic of all plastics. The student could have taken more samples to draw an average and could have left the plastics longer.
es_3HFNH7HEMJR6WHHQ2GZ9QYMK8PCGQK	Each material has different hardness scales.
es_3HWRJOOET7FKPJ0COPYQLVG9DZGSE6	According to the test, the plastic with the highest elasticity is B and the one with the lowest elasticity is A. Not only the length but also the thickness (caliber) of the plastic and the total mass should be taken into account because I consider that these two factors help the result of the experiment to yield the expected results.
es_3HWRJOOET7FKPJ0COPYQLVG9M1OESD	The length that the plastic gained in the two tests was not very great, only for types A and B, very little, in fact type C lost length in the second test.n The first way would be to do three tests, and the second way would be to add the same amount of weight to the plastics.
es_3I02618YA2J41NH6M891U8X1C22PU1	a. I think to measure the elasticity would have required more time. I could have left the weights longer and I think the weight should be indicated and be somehow proportional perhaps to the length.
es_3I3WADAZ9SH5V8FQ67OEXW0VB2BO5F	According to this table, four different calculations of A, B, C, D and their content of p1 and p2. Plastic contains a table b is the highest score in the table and 45 and a is the lowest score. Plastic is a very bad component, its causes are very bad. Four scores must be average.
es_3IJXV6UZ1ZWK492L5JOCG095JOFRIX	In plastic A the plastic was stretched 2 mm. In B, the plastic was stretched by 1 mm.  In C it must be wrong, because not only did it not stretch, but it shrunk according to your data. On D, it stayed the same.  My guess is that he is either wrong or needs new lenses. The measurement of C is clearly wrong. You should redo the whole experiment and write down the results on the spot.
es_3IX2EGZR7DWGZKMRN19CS1O51C9JRT	a. Based on the data we can see how the different plastics vary in elasticity .b. The student should have noted the size of the plastics initially and should have put a plastic without any weight to see the variable.
es_3J4Q2Z4UT0G2T37QHL3RC1887P1QWL	"Conclusion: The elasticity of plastics ""B"" and ""D"" is approximately double compared to the elasticity of plastics ""A"" and ""C"". One way in which the student could have improved this experiment is if the student could repeat the procedures and thus validate the results in a more concrete way. Another way to improve these results is for the student to group the plastics with similar elasticity, separating them from the others. In that way, the data table would be easier to read and interpret."
es_3JJVG1YBEDALCEQH22JSRC0W1TDB5W	a. Plastic polymer D has greater consistency, as it has gained the same length during both tests. The student should have indicated the lengths of the samples before the weights, not simply the length that the samples have gained (it is unclear based on the data whether all plastics have the same length), so as to calculate the percent length that each plastic has gained. Also the design could be improved by indicating the mass of the weights applied to each sample.
es_3JV9LGBJWVR3B54AN3751TRKU81GOO	a) All the plastic materials used by the student elongate variably under the same circumstances. Except for material D which elongates constantly. b) You could have performed a larger number of tests for each material first, so that the results would have been more conclusive. Describe at what exact measurement height you placed the clamp.
es_3JZQSN0I3SN95SRHO0OFEZI66IIGF0	The plastic with the highest elasticity is plastic A. To improve the design of the experiment the student should have used a new piece of plastic (of the same type) for each time he repeated the trials for each plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to ensure that the weights are hung within the same measurements for each trial, i.e., if the weight hangs within 1mm, and the others hang within 1mm, to ensure that the weight strength is in proportion to the other trials.
es_3K3R2QNK8DGJ901Z5JD48IXM8T19UY	In relation to the results, it can be seen that the average of the centimeters measured after stretching in both tests is quite similar. This could be adjusted more if instead of using free weights I used a device that pulled the plastic the same length in both tests.
es_3K3R2QNK8DGJ901Z5JD48IXM8U6U9Q	a. Different types of plastics have different elasticity. Record the initial length of each plastic, the weight used and the time taken.
es_3K4J6M3CXG6E91A9DK2N0Y7F4DYGAX	a. It is concluded that the structure of plastic C develops a tensile strength because in the second measurement it contracts instead of stretching further. Plastic D is stable in tension because in the two measurements the length gain is equal. Plastics A and B are less resistant to tension because in each test they lengthened a little. The student could also have taken the length of the plastic samples without removing the weights and compared that length to the original length. The subtraction of these lengths constitutes the true elasticity of the plastic. The second way to improve the experiment is to make more than two measurements (tests P3, P4, etc.). This allows a graphical representation of the elongation compared against the stress by the applied weight and would allow to establish the permanent deformation of each plastic in relation to the weight.
es_3KB8R4ZV1GKJSBF1JY2JV9RLPQKGBM	I think it should be improved with an afddfd bar graph.
es_3KXIR214I6T9SIML5477LRRE448246	You could apply more plastic
es_3KXIR214I6T9SIML5477LRREBAI24Z	There are some plastics that have different elasticities. Plastic A and B gained length but plastic C and D lost length. The student could heat the plastic or freeze the plastic to get better results and to improve the design of the experiment.
es_3LEP4MGT3IDGGR5AH81BPOOO9V7DB3	A) We see how the plastic has gained length in both experiments, so by adding weight to the plastic it gains lengthB) Count exactly the seconds in which weight is applied to the plastic and use different weights.
es_3LEP4MGT3IDGGR5AH81BPOOOC7OBD9	a. The test performed has an error of +/- 2 mm, based on the results obtained, and taking into account the size of the plastics, the test performed is not very feasible to know the properties of the polymers, but it is feasible to know if there is elasticity in a polymer. One way may have been to thermally isolate the experiment to prevent the temperature variable from affecting the behavior of the polymers, and another way would be to minimize the human error of measurement by doing it with appropriate machinery.
es_3LO69W1SU5QV5K1DABRD9CNQ2EZGLZ	Samples 1 and 2 had an increase in length, sample 4 had no increase, and sample 3 had a decrease. If the student had placed a graded wait frame and filmed the bending of the material he could have found the elastic resistance of each material.
es_3LO69W1SU5QV5K1DABRD9CNQZFNGLM	In conclusion, I could say that it is, let's say, good, there is no room for improvement.
es_3LQ8PUHQFN57FFOI9ECI2W7Z6U0HID	a)Plastic A is the least elastic.nb1)Prepare the weights glued to the plastic before placing themnb2)Know the date of manufacture of the plastics.
es_3LQ8PUHQFN57FFOI9ECI2W7ZXEOIHX	take into account in the data table the initial total length of the plastic sample
es_3M23Y66PO4KGC47XI7FS97OWWY4S6R	The first conclusion from these data is that plastic C has a structure that develops yield strength when subjected to tension, because in the second measurement it contracts rather than expands. Plastic D becomes stress stable because in the two measurements its length gain was equal. For plastics A and B, on the other hand, their structure undergoes permanent deformation under tension because in each test they elongate more. 1) one way in which the experiment could have been improved is also to have taken the length of the samples when they still have the weight attached. the difference between this length and the original length corresponds to the true elasticity of each plastic. 2) The second test should be done with a higher weight and thus a graph showing the permanent deformation of each plastic depending on the weight to which it is subjected each time can be started. An important piece of information needed is the original length of each plastic part, so that both its true elasticity and permanent deformation can be determined.
es_3MH9DQ757YPYOAO7JPJE0ZJ9CABUGX	According to its plasticity, the plastic polymer stretches and therefore increases in length in 3 of the 4 cases. To improve the experiment, it could be attached to the inside of a table instead of the edge of a table.
es_3MX2NQ3YCB7SPHTI7YBAG9ROFJ8X53	a. According to the data obtained, we can say that materials A and C have a lower elasticity than materials B and D. One way to make the results more valid would be to make at least one more measurement and then create an average with all the results obtained.
es_3MX2NQ3YCB7SPHTI7YBAG9ROJ4L5XY	Plastic D is the most elastic. \Use the same type of plastic in series to see if there are differences.
es_3N1FSUEFL7DWVSK12TROHAIIZA24DE	a. It can be seen that the elasticity of plastics goes in the following order B > D > C > A. The second test (P2) seems to confirm the results obtained in the first test (P1). The design could have been improved by varying the atmospheric conditions, for example, by performing another series of experiments to evaluate how different temperatures affect the elasticity of each plastic. To improve validity, the number of tests performed could have been increased.
es_3N1FSUEFL7DWVSK12TROHAIIZG5D42	Plastic polymer A is the most elastic because it underwent less deformation after it was subjected to elongation. To improve the design of the experiment, the initial length of the plastic samples and also the length when they were with the weights should have been noted. Additionally, indicate whether the second test was performed with the same samples or with different samples.
es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGC349DUW	Polymer D recovers its size after the test, in case it was altered at the time of the test, if the size was not altered that polymer is the one with the best resistance to deformation, polymers A and B do not recover their size in case it is different from the beginning, they have less resistance to deformation. For me it is necessary to know how much the polymers measure at the beginning and during the experiment to draw better conclusions if it is not me who does it and only read this information
es_3NPFYT4IZEHQ5EI2OUU1K6ID8Y4XGI	a. The conclusion of the experiment is that the polymer A and B were more elastic than C and D. Choosing another type of materials to replace polymer C and D, and obtain better results.
es_3NPI0JQDAQIP1A2HM3JRPCBZTL6TPJ	Polymers A and B underwent an elongation in the presence of a load at one of their ends, while polymer D remained the same length and polymer C underwent a retraction of its length. \To improve the experiment it would be necessary to know the loads applied to the polymers, to control the environmental temperature and to define the lengths and thicknesses of the different samples.
es_3NXNZ5RS1CAHBPP3SBKTYQJ280D97D	Comprehensive student trainingnAcademic management: school services and administrationnAcademic regulationsnQuick consultation
es_3NXNZ5RS1CAHBPP3SBKTYQJ2ZP3978	a. It is concluded that the type of plastic B and D have greater capacity to stretch than the type A and C. By having a greater repeatability the experiment would have better results, since the experiment was only repeated 2 times; also to improve the experiment it could have been had a greater amount of types of plastics since 4 with very few.
es_3O7L7BFSHG2VV5XGJD4CHTAM5KZIES	The student's data are not conclusive, since at the moment of starting the investigation, the original measurement of each polymer before starting the experiment is not shown in the table. One way to improve this experiment is to modify the table by placing the initial values of each polymer, so that having this data, we can make an effective comparison and know the elastic variation of each polymer. It would be interesting to place to each polymer, an equal weight and the same amount of time to each of the strips of the polymer samples. In this way, we will have beforehand a visual result of each one of the samples, and later, we proceed to take the measurements of each polymer to obtain the elastic variation of each one, and thus, a table is made with the data obtained.
es_3O7L7BFSHG2VV5XGJD4CHTAMDFLEI8	It can be concluded that different weights were used to test the elasticity of the plastic. It may be that for each sample the weight was different or the times were different, the data table does not specify the length of the plastic, or the weight used to test the elasticity of each plastic. nnThe student could have improved the study by giving more material specific information such as:nn* Length of plasticon* How much weight was adhered to the plasticon* How much weight adhered to the clamp* Collect data on how much was adhered to the plastic the first and the second time nnConcluding that plastic A and B are more elastic than plastics C and D. Plastic A and B have greater elasticity after the second test. Plastic C and D on the contrary remain with the same stiffness as in the first test, they maintained the same and very close lengthitute between P1 and P2.
es_3OCHAWUVGQXV70ELELFGIYA6EICKX4	a. The plastic deforms when it is exposed to a weight at one of its ends, and that deformation depends on the weight and length of the plastic. One could have measured the length that a plastic deforms once it has been previously deformed, i.e., one would have to put another weight on it again. Another way to look at the results differently is to leave the weights on longer and see if it affects the time the plastic is exposed to a weight.
es_3OLF68YTNBE8V1EE20W5ID733SPFAC	a. We can observe, according to the results, that the weight applied to the plastics has exceeded the elastic limit of these, since when removing the force they have suffered a permanent deformation. We can also observe that the tests, in most cases, have not been performed under the same conditions since the results have been different, this may be due to a different size of the plastic, an extra force applied without realizing it or even the fixation to the table.To improve the validity of the results could have included the length and section of the plastic and also the weight of the applied force. One way to improve the design of the experiment would be to use a clamp and hook bolted to a fixed surface to hold the plastic as they are much more stable than not attaching the plastic with glue or tape.
es_3OS46CRSLHCW4WO1C2KXKU83WBXV6H	a. Plastic D did not undergo any change, unlike A and B which elongated and C which contracted, which means that the most elastic plastics are A, B and C. The student should have included the data of the length of the plastics before applying the test, as well as indicating the weight that was being added in each test.
es_3OS4RQUCRBSDEBJ68EW1DOR9NIFBFQ	a. Based on the results obtained from the observation, we can conclude that type B and D plastics are the most elastic, where the length difference is approximately 50-100% greater than C and A plastics respectively. There is no consistency in the results for the first 3 plastics. This would indicate that perhaps the clamp location was not accurate or that the test time was not correctly measured. In the same way, it would be necessary to corroborate if the initial cut of the plastics was of equal length and that the proportion of the sample that was glued to the table versus the one that was hanging was exactly similar among the 8 samples.
es_3OS4RQUCRBSDEBJ68EW1DOR9UMKFBE	A)nPlastics in general tend to elongate with weight. nPlastics A and B elongate, we can think that they have elastic properties and are less resistant. But plastic C shortens, we can think that the action of the weight causes the plastic to shorten or that there is an error in the design of the study. nB)nThe student could have used a more precise way to glue the plastics, perhaps not all are placed at the same distance from the poor person, and make sure that the plastics have the same width and the same thickness. n He should also take new plastics at the time of the second test and double the time, in order to measure the variable of time correctly.
es_3OSWBBLG1GANTU8BM4TTELFGSG7XD8	Length that A is 22
es_3OSWBBLG1GANTU8BM4TTELFGUK9XDK	A. The polymers appear to be quite similar in consistency; stretching about the same amount in both cases. However, A and C appear to share the same type of elasticity, which is less than B and D (also quite similar). Using several samples of the same type of plastic, to replicate results... and make the measurements with different weights.
es_3OSWBBLG1GANTU8BM4TTELFGUYCDXV	Plastic sample A is the most elastic, plastic sample D is not elastic. \Note the initial length and draw differences, since plastics have a maximum elasticity, according to the force applied,
es_3OUYGIZWR9BOL15QO1VH519UWA4P0Y	Based on the table, plastic type B would be the best choice because its numbers are the highest (22,23).
es_3OUYGIZWR9BOL15QO1VH519UWCXP0V	a) Plastic A was the most elastic of the samples, it stretched below 12 mm in both experiments P1 and P2, which was slightly more elastic than plastic C. Plastic D was significantly less elastic, and stretched 20 mm in both replicates, plastic B was the least elastic, however, and had stretched over 22 mm in both experiments.To improve the experimental results, the number of experiments performed should be increased and the factors varied. Different weights should be used and the plastic should be positioned in different ways to ensure that all aspects of elasticity are taken into account.
es_3P4RDNWND7J36LJ8XEF3E9NE951IJ8	The 4 plastic polymers differ in their ability to increase in size upon application of tensile force, polymers A and B increase in size, while C shrinks and D returns to its original state upon removal. The student could have measured the plastic samples while they were under the tension exerted by the weight and finally applied different weights to observe whether the amount of weight influences the degree of elasticity of the polymer.
es_3P529IW9K0YPRK5IZRLVRRNE1XHFLD	A. The conclusion drawn from the data is that the plastics gained length each time the experiment was done with the exception of plastic type C which did not gain length and plastic type D which remained the same. The student could have improved the experimental design if he had taken a video to validate the results.
es_3P529IW9K0YPRK5IZRLVRRNE2NWLFF	because everything is fantastic
es_3PH3VY7DJNAB7V8H4HM43UKCIM5ZW1	a. The plastic C lost length instead of gaining length, it is not logical for this to happen.nb. 1. Use two support points and a horizontal rigid rail.n 2.

Plastic sample A has higher elasticity than the remaining plastic samples, i.e., B, C and D.n Plastic samples B and C have equal elasticity, being lower than sample A and higher than sample D.n Plastic sample D is shown to have lower elasticity than the samples presented, i.e., A, B and C.nnb. You can use a press to measure the higher elasticity of the samples.n You can place the samples at the same time and measure the time it takes for them to stretch, and thus measure the stretching time.

es_3PPTZCWALSX6NYCVS8NYB52QJDKQZT	a) The plastics mostly tend to expand with applied weight, but the length gained with weight is not uniform over time, except for polymer D, which in both tests expanded at the same rate.
es_3PPTZCWALSX6NYCVS8NYB52QKCGQZO	a. With time and weight the plastics change in length. Do a third test with two more types of plastics.
es_3PXX5PX6LZBIIK2YXYA9ZNGIRJHABQ	well first of all we must take into account the type of plastic used and what is its elasticity. also take into account the angle which was placed in the first test if the angle in the first test was different from 90 degrees the data collected in the second test may give different, and that is why there is a slight change in the samples. we can also think that the sample weights that hung from the plastic could be net in their weights in the first test but in the second test they changed either by wear or use. physically it is proven that the changes in gravity experiments like this one (both gravity and elastic force also within newton's laws) are subject to different changes, I hope you like my answer and rate positive.
es_3PZDLQMM0VYCNMZ0YJDP4P32US72CL	a. The student had a brilliant idea in doing that experiment on the polymers as he had a great result which I see is remarkable. The student would have chosen a plastic with longer length to have high results and big difference.
es_3Q5C1WP23OEKZG8P05Q3L0NNB5Y51R	a. Of all the plastics only type D has gained the same length in the two tests. The student could group the plastics according to their compositions to get more results.
es_3Q5C1WP23OEKZG8P05Q3L0NNH4315W	a. Plastic type B is the most elastic and type A is the least elastic. By performing a larger number of tests and decreasing the unit of measurement so that it is more accurate than a millimeter.
es_3Q5ZZ9ZEVQS2AGSAZQZI0AAVOJT85I	Plastic samples A and C stretched the least, while B and D stretched the most. B was the one that stretched the most but D was the only one that was constant in both tests so it seems to give more assurance of its quality. The results seem valid since he measured the length of stretch of the plastic after stretching it for a prolonged period of time.  However, it should have measured the maximum elongation before breaking.
es_3QAPZX2QN6QSTU4KM3K59O11MKU029	a. plastic B is the most elastic while plastic A is the least elastic. b. The student could have given the initial and final length of the polymers. The student could have given the initial and final length of the polymers.
es_3QAPZX2QN6QSTU4KM3K59O11Q78021	a. According to the data provided, type A plastic is the most elastic of the four and type B is the least elastic. 1. The elasticity does not depend on the time of being subjected to a load but on the weight, therefore it would not be necessary to wait 5 minutes. 2. Having gained the 4 polymers in length after the experiment, it is understood that in the 4 cases the elasticity limit of the materials has been exceeded. I would recommend to try with smaller weights without reaching this limit and measure the length gained with the weight on.
es_3QAVNHZ3EOHUVTOAOBZ3DQCN1Q8LAP	a. The most elastic plastic specimen was type B. The least elastic plastic sample, and therefore probably the stiffest, was type A. The student could have repeated the study a third time to ensure reproducibility of his results. In addition, the student could have tried the test with different amounts of weight for each type of plastic to create a pattern that tells us how much each type of plastic stretches per unit weight.
es_3QAVNHZ3EOHUVTOAOBZ3DQCN1QCLAT	"answer to. \THE LENGTH GAINED BY POLYMER ""B"" SHOWS THE HIGHEST ELASTICITY FOLLOWED BY SAMPLE ""D"", SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SAMPLE ""C"" HAS THE THIRD PLACE IN FOLLOWING ELASTICITY AND LASTLY ""A"" SHOWS WITH ALMOST HALF THE ELASTICITY OF SAMPLE ""B"" AND ""D"".\n-FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD COLOR THE LENGTH OF THE SAMPLES WITHOUT APPLYING ANY TENSION TO THEM, THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY BEYOND THE FINAL RESULTS OTHER PERCENTAGE PARAMETERS THAT WILL HELP THE STUDY.\THE ELASTICITY MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH WEIGHT ON, BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT TAKEN IN THE STUDY SHOWS THE ELASTICITY WHEN THE MATERIAL ""RECOVERED"" PART OF ITS INITIAL CONDITIONS AND THE MAIN IDEA IS TO SEE WHICH HAS THE HIGHEST ELASTICITY."
es_3QEMNNSB2ZCTEF2K4RPVKM2SQ6JD7M	The most flexible sample is B and the least flexible sample is A. \On the other hand, sample D is the most uniform since both samples give the same value. The other samples have variable values within an admissible limit.
es_3QEMNNSB2ZCTEF2K4RPVKM2SQ717D0	a. Polymer A has great elasticity, polymer B and C have lower elasticity and 4 has no elasticity. He could have measured the polymers before the first experiment to measure the elasticity. He could also have used another way to enlarge the samples.
es_3QEMNNSB2ZCTEF2K4RPVKM2SV5ED7K	a. It is observed in the results that plastic type B is the most elastic of all, because it is the one that gains the most length, followed by D (which is almost equally elastic). It is obtained that the least elastic are C and A. Also, it turned out that all plastics gained considerable length. First, the student must place the initial size of the plastics in order to compare it with the final size after the experiment. In addition, the student must specify the type of polymer and conclude its degree of elasticity compared to the others.
es_3QFUFYSY90STTCYXTZME5AL3JLQF4C	a. Based on the information provided, plastic C shrunk compared to the other plastics and there was no difference in plastic D. b. Two ways the student could improve the experiment: 1. They could mention the names of the types of plastics, 2. They could be more specific in the amount of weight used in the experiment.
es_3QUO65DNQW1MGN5578WM58SB2VYUOD	a) We see that the plastics deform and stretch with the added weight. Each type of plastic deforms differently: the first 2 gain length, which is to be expected; however, the third one shrinks after pressure and the last one is more resistant and stays the same. b) At first sight, the data that I think should have been recorded and that is missing among those recorded is the weight added to the plastics. I think that several tests could be done with more and less weight to see how this affects the plastics and how the deformations vary. Another data that could be included in the study is the time, I think that the same deformation will not be caused after 5 minutes with a weight that after 1 hour or after 24. In short, I think the study could be done by testing and recording different weights and times for each plastic.
es_3QXNC7EIPK83TEPJ7CZKJB9F2SW097	a. The conclusion is that polymer B is the most elastic of the four tested. nb. Two ways to improve the experiment are 1. to include the original measurement of each sample and 2. to include the amount of weight hung on each sample.

es_3R8YZBNQ9JVN3O6P9DVFKL9RBUAQ7Q	in plastic type C, the length was less than its initial length, it should see if there was an error in measuring and the student should have a greater number of trials to make the experiment more accurate.
es_3R9WASFE21T9W9MMESC4Z6YCNMKZFE	I see that the student got good results, not that the student could have done a better experiment.

es_3RRCEFRB7OP3GVMHOX0IMKUIWOL4B0	a) Plastic polymer B stretches the most while plastic polymer A stretches the least. b) Testing the same plastic with different weights, several times, would increase the accuracy/validity of the data. Also, all plastics should have the same length at the start of the experiment, which is not specified in the procedure.
es_3RSDURM96CZHL5CLNVQF3H4AXHWYE7	the experiment is not very reproducible. You could have improved the experiment with more traceability, i.e. by putting the weights you used and the order in which you did it and making sure that the plastic was glued in exactly the same place, both with the different polymers and in the different tests.
es_3RWE2M8QWJNOIGTD8MIP1C4Z0SU0N2	a) plastic type B is more elastic, and plastic type A is less elastic b) Increase the number of samples to decrease the error, vary the weights applied to the plastic and compare the elongation percentage.
es_3RWE2M8QWJNOIGTD8MIP1C4Z1XHN0N	a. Nothing can be concluded. The experiment is incomplete. For example, what is the thickness of each sample? Describe the characteristics of each sample and use samples with the same dimensions. Use an apparatus that exerts force gradually.
es_3S06PH7KSTHF3TNIFB8MJCBFXHW1DU	a. Results may correspond depending on the weight hung, plastic types A, B and D probably showed the expected results. nb. Plastic type C is the clearest example of an improved design due to a reduction in size when it should stretch.
es_3S4AW7T80DVFT48TFAPC0NQN8C2L4V	The plastics gained length thanks to the weight added to the clamps, the student could have used small weights or a scale for his experiment.
es_3S96KQ6I9OHGCDZRHUSWPIUAKY5TD4	The conclusion based on the student's data is that the increasing order of elasticity of the polymers is A, C, D and B. To improve the validity of the study the student could do more tests or increase the number of test types (e.g. tests with more weights or tests with more time).

es_3SEPORI8WPCE0I5E3CQCL5NLNXUAZE	Plastic B was the one that gained the least length and D stayed the same, C stayed smaller and A was the one that gained the most length. The student could have cancelled out the polymers that got smaller or stayed the same.

es_3SUWZRL0M0QF2L2FHCVNKQKHV6T6E0	Sometimes it is good to have a costant like always adding the same weight to all the plastics to see how much electisity it has, but since not one plastic was the same as the other you could have tried to hang it from different areas or use a little more or less weight.
es_3TAYZSBPLNLSU3OWV53PJU7KLYFS22	Initially we can conclude that some plastic materials have the ability to stretch a little and this is because the material possibly causes the molecules to generate more space between them resulting in some of the numbers that we can find in the table provided. It would be good to have known the type of plastic materials that were used to have a greater certainty as to why some had a greater elongation and others did not. These results serve to confirm that the plastic material has a slight possibility of conversion without the use of other tools such as fire, but only using gravity. Now, we must also take into account certain factors such as temperature because if it was hot this could have helped the material to yield and become longer or on the contrary it was only gravity that helped to give these results: \n1. under a controlled environment that does not allow temperature to affect the stretching of the material and that weight is the only controlling factor. It is also important that the procedure is done with different types of weights that have a considerable variation to be included in the box as one of the possible stretching factors of the material. Part of the validity of these experiments is to know the level of resistance of the elements that we are going to use (this can be found in google) and thus give different weights to generate a possible breakage of the material (to know its maximum resistance) so that we can have more data in the results box and explain more precisely the results and factors for which there was or was not a stretching of the material.
es_3TMSXRD2X8DECZN9W6DCB000ZCS1WI	"a.  It appears that type ""B"" plastic has more elasticity than the other types; type ""A"" has less elasticity than the other types; type ""D"" is the second most elastic; type ""C"" is the third most elastic.  But it is possible that the samples were not of the same length, and/or that the weights were not equal, and if not, no conclusion can be drawn.  The student could improve the experimental design by using samples of the same length, and also by using equal weights with each sample."
es_3TPZPLC3M2PK2T4N7OD07Z71634P3E	a. Plastics B and C stretch more than A and C nb. I could have repeated the experiment more than 2 times to know if they are consistent. I could have used different weights to study the behavior of the material.

The more times the weight was applied the more deformation, the less deformation than A. The decrease in the length of the plastic was 1mm less than the 1st time. There was no difference in the size of the plastic the second time. The initial deformation did not vary. \The test should have been repeated more times until the breaking point was reached to obtain strength specifications for each plastic polymer.

es_3U5NZHP4LTFZW1BMM922BT8BI1TPH7	Conclusion: Plastic types A and B are the most elastic: \n- Do the tests on all four types of plastic simultaneously.\n- Do the measurement before removing the weights. \Use samples of the same dimensions for each type of plastic.
es_3UN61F00HY28SL76YZ5IRR50FNZR5K	a. Based on the student's data, it can be concluded that the results of the first test did not change much in the second test.

It would be interesting to know the value of the weight attached to the clamps to establish the weight-elongation relationship. They could have measured the resistance of the material, applying the formula Force divided by area
es_3VBEN272MMCI9XW3UKOELY1LUFBSG7	a) Plastic type B is the most elastic followed by type D, thirdly type C and lastly type D. Good accuracy in the results (little dispersion) Leave the plastic hanging on a nail on the wall to perform the measurement in a better way. There is not much dispersion in the results so there should not be undetermined errors in the experiment.
es_3VFJCI1K41C68IWQFVO9VOWP49NRG1	My conclusion is that the plastic sample marked with the letter B is the one with the highest elasticity. Perhaps using some kind of pulley where the plastic material could be elongated and thus test its elasticity.
es_3VFJCI1K41C68IWQFVO9VOWP5C9RGU	A) Polymer B had the most elasticity, while polymer A had the least elasticity. B) You could repeat the experiment again, because two data are not enough to draw a conclusion. You could also do experiments at different temperatures.

The data, once selected and collected, must be coded, a process that consists of transferring the information to specially designed forms, which are then copied or punched into electronic processing cards to be stored in the computer.1 The storage is done in fixed-size files, by means of a program that structures a single set in the form of a two-dimensional matrix that is then copied or punched into electronic processing cards to be stored in the computer.1
es_3W2LOLRXLDSBA4S95M9OTGOIEJNRKC	It is not clear if the student used pieces of plastic bags as plastic samples, but it is most likely. The elasticity and length of these plastics may increase depending on the quality of the material, since not all bags are the same in terms of plastic thickness. The experiment for my taste lacked a little more analysis, since simply measuring the length was not all that could be taken out of the experiment. The resistance of the plastics could also have been part of the results. The student could have improved the experiment by adding other variables, such as the resistance to break after measuring the maximum length. Another important point the student could have added was to vary the weight on each plastic to increase the length and express in the results what was the weight where the plastic broke.
es_3W92K5RLWWU0LSON7JASSOU323U5VV	a) The only conclusion that can be made is that polymer D has resistance to the weights during the five minutes. b) To have better results, the initial measurement would have been determined by two polymers and a third test (P3).
es_3W92K5RLWWU0LSON7JASSOU366EV5F	Material B is the most elastic of all, followed by D. A and C are very similar. To improve the experiment, more tests should have been done and perhaps two clamps should have been used to stretch the polymers until they broke.
es_3WI0P0II6353WYMZD5N1P3TSUJWDR9	Assuming that all samples have the same initial length it is evident that plastic type A is the stiffest of all, followed by C, then D and finally B. To improve the design of the experiment could have recorded the initial length of the sample and the area of its initial cross section.
es_3WLEIWSYHQU34UAGKBRQFG0I7O0H25	a) Plastics A and C are the strongest, since they do not change much in length with weights.  Plastics B and D are similar and much weaker. b) The student could have said how much weight was placed on the plastics to make everything more consistent. He could also have said how long the plastics were before the experiment, so we can know the percentage of length gained.
es_3WS1NTTKE0PCUOGWAYZCT7VQU81F0D	The types of plastics used were of different material, elasticity and thickness.
es_3WSELTNVR5FIE6WFXK1UZHM4V85TAL	The problem in this case is that the experiment does not explicitly indicate that the samples used are of the same length, so the measure of length gained by the plastic does not tell us much, since it is not the same to gain 22mm for a sample of 120mm than to gain them with a sample of 500mm.\To improve the experiment I would propose the following improvements:- Always use samples of the same length. Repeat the experiment more times and use the average as a reference.
es_3WT783CTPDU6BZZWHC605I66Y74CB9	a. The experiment shows that the length gained by the plastic is consistent.and depends on the polymer chosen.nb. Do the procedure more times to improve the reliability of the result.

The two tests are based on the same procedure, I do not understand why the results are different. The only logic I can find is that the types of plastics are different. \Hypothesis. It may be likely to apply some heat to make the plastics more elastic.
es_3X73LLYYQ3RZTGZ96UPA743GIEQHNL	The results are inconclusive. A better way would be to use different weights to see which one survives the plastic. Another would be to use different plastics with the same procedure.
es_3X73LLYYQ3RZTGZ96UPA743GQ6QHND	Based on the data, some plastics stretch more than others. Some have more resistance than others. nTo improve the experiment, the weight of the weights could be more. Also do the experiment but heat the plastic at different temperatures.
es_3X87C8JFV8O9MMQHXGTQFC5N0M9SQV	a) Due to the weight used and applied to each of the plastics by means of the clamp it can be observed that certain types of plastics have greater resistance than others, in fact plastic number C contracted after having applied weight, while other types of plastics such as D remained unchanged. b) The student could have improved the experiment by doubling the time the plastics were kept hanging together with the weight, also making sure that all types of plastics had exactly the same weight and the same measurement diameter.
es_3X87C8JFV8O9MMQHXGTQFC5N3GMQSX	Plastic B has the longest length gained of all the plastics.nnTwo ways the student could have improved the design was by writing down how much the plastics measured at the beginning and also by averaging the two tests.
es_3XIQGXAUMEL7CL71VRQ7ET5K9OA7X0	a. The average length that the different types of plastic gained was 16.5mm. First, the student could have used more types of plastic to make a better comparison. Then, the student could have performed more tests to reduce any errors in measurement.
es_3XLBSAQ9Z6PWHG7GW9ESBELVEQNZ75	The types of plastic and their results differ by about 1 to 3 mm comparing the two tests. It seems to me that plastic D is the most accurate because it was 20 mm in P1 and 20 mm in P2.  Plastic C decreases in average and plastic A and B increase in size. The student could improve the results by leaving the weights for longer times and also increase the weight of the weights to see if there are differences.
es_3Y4W8Q93L1XVP53GMPSBQ0IVEYSDV2	a) Gravity deforms the plastics, b) by making 1 to 1, or by weighting each plastic individually.
es_3Y4W8Q93L1XVP53GMPSBQ0IVGGADVM	A greater increase in length in the P2 table compared to others. The length of C decreased where D remains the same.
es_3YDGXNSEO17KEXOALLG8VI4HTUW48Q	The most flexible plastic was type A because it gained more length at the end of the experiment. It would have been better to use some kind of apparatus that could apply torque to the different types of plastic so the researchers knew exactly how much force was applied to the plastic.
es_3YDTZAI2WZT23X4PM07TG8H9DGK14F	Polymers A and B have a higher elongation capacity than polymers C and D. Polymer C has undergone shrinkage and polymer D is not able to elongate. The dimensions (width, length and thickness) of the plastic pieces must also be defined.

es_3YHH42UU5DSYUGQSW92AOK0AW930LY	Abstract This assignment is part of a data collection study at the University of Duisburg-Essen. The assignment is to read the description of a simple science experiment and answer a question about the experiment.Please read the assignment description carefully. You should also pay attention to the tables or pictures included in the exercises. Answer the question in English, using one or two sentences. Please answer the questions using your knowledge to the best of your ability. Answers that do not make sense or are copies of others will be rejected.
es_3YMTUJH0DUT3CHGYOJR3ME04AR14T6	a) The conclusion is that the first plastics (A and B) are not elastic, but have been deformed and the variation between tests may be due to anchorage. The reason for the differential between P1 and P2 in plastics A and B is due to the fact that 2 materials subjected to the same stress can elongate differently. (modulus of elasticity.)nnb) Rather than measuring the length the plastic has gained, I would take the plastics to the point of rupture and verify that they have broken at the same length. Additionally, I would check the anchorage (not make it horizontal, but find a way to make it vertical).
es_3YOH7BII0BK33B9QE6EYUDDLY0SKVB	The conclusion I draw is that the 4 types of plastic A,B,C,D are not of the same type of plastic since the elongations gained in the series of experiments P1 are not the 4 equal, and within them, the most ductile plastics would be the B and D. I can think of 2 improvements: \n1º Make more series of tests, 5 would be good to be able to get an average that is closer to the real value and has less deviation. \n2º Write down the mass of the weights added in each test, which is unknown now.
es_3YZ8UPK3VVZL7Y82H3NVA8YUDG6CUN	According to the results, polymer A is the least elastic of all while polymer B is the most elastic of all since a higher elongation is observed. The result of this experiment is affected by the temperature of the environment so it should not be done in hot environments or with temperature variations for one polymer or another. Several series of measurements can be made with the same polymers to obtain an average result and thus obtain a more accurate result.
es_3Z4AIRP3C8QT1ZSZ6B9YDJE78VN1XY	What is the relationship between type of plastic and length of plastic?
es_3Z4XG4ZF4A4BCZCK5WIDST1FHCRX8T	can elaborate further and say that this is the goal of this experiment.
es_3Z4XG4ZF4A4BCZCK5WIDST1FIH2X8F	If we take the variations in percentages, the results are 20%, 4.55%, -7.14% and 0%. The conclusion is that plastic type C has an elasticity contrary to that of the other samples, while type D appears to be the least flexible. To improve the results, all the samples could have been taken with the same length and several tests could have been carried out, as the result of sample C does not seem consistent.
es_3Z7EFSHGNBRDO22XM8YIUFXY727CX7	a) Plastic A and plastic C are stiffer than B and D. There is a small margin of error because P1 and P2 are different in almost all samples. b) The experiment could have been improved by taking samples at different temperatures, since this affects the elasticity of the plastic. For the same reason, the validity of the results would be higher if the student had made sure to take all 8 measurements at the same temperature.
es_3Z7ISHFUH280HUCZ6E6YPEHQSBL8ZY	Based on the data, the elasticity of plastics A and B change after 5 minutes of stretching, but C and D do not appear to have stretched. One way the student could improve the design of the experiment would be to use various ranges of stretching periods (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc) to compare them more adequately.
es_3Z9WI9EOZ11YLAE69HXUFCMCXHLKHO	E.s truethe conclusion is that things happen.
es_3ZAK8W07I6R1D6DM5NUBF7WTDF2U0Q	The conclusion based on the data is that three of the plastic samples do not demonstrate much elasticity.n To improve the design of the experiment and validate the results, the student could have included the weight applied to each sample and included the weight of the clamp.
es_3ZAZR5XV03V2TX2CNQM3R0D9ICYZC7	Well, if the student used the same plastics for P2, then we can assume that 2 plastics stretched, one shrunk, and one stayed the same. It appears that the student did not record the 2 measurements at the beginning and end of each test. The student should have written down the measurements before and after each test, i.e., there should have been 2 numbers for each test that would show before and after the experiment was done with each plastic. There would be a more correct conclusion.
es_3ZDAD0O1T3QUAJ488UT8JPX24A3XTO	as noted in each plastic sample, they obtained length changes except for D which was stable in length and there were no changes.n I could highlight more in this experiment by using a little more weight to highlight the length more.
es_3ZGVPD4G6VUJFE4N9CHTGADDBBETZV	a. Sample D is the most elastic. The ayb specimens report permanent deformations. Sample C is shortened.nb. Use specimens of the same shape.

es_3ZSY5X72NZOU0VDO3E1H0X5RW5IORA	To improve the validity of the results, the student should have used all measurements with the same length and analyze the difference between the results. As the lengths are different it is difficult to assume the quality of the experiment.
es_3ZV9H2YQQFKAM21OJARVZTFXZ1QW31	a. The conclusion is that the most elastic plastic of all the samples is B, since on average it gained 22.5 mm, two millimeters more than the second most elastic sample, D, which stretched 20 mm on average. The third most elastic sample was C, which stretched on average 13.5. The least elastic sample of the four would be A, which stretched on average 11 mm.nnb. The student could improve the validity of the results in two ways: one, by expanding the range of samples. That is, instead of doing the experiment with four plastics, do it with more. The second way would be to perform more tests, since with only two the results may be partial and not entirely conclusive.
es_3ZWFC4W1UWK0UI0V4BIRD3WD5OARFF	a. Based on the student's data, Plastic D is the least elastic. It did not stretch or spring back. Plastic A and B are somewhat more elastic, because they stretched but did not come back. Plastic C is the most elastic. The final length is shorter because of stretching and recoil. The student could have measured the length of the plastics as the weights were placed.
