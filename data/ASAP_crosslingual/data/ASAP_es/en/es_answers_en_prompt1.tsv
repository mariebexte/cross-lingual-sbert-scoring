es_308Q0PEVBAQE096ZB2OQPF9BDIFI93	I would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers and perhaps the room conditions (e.g., humidity level). I would also need to know what instrument was used to determine the mass.
es_30LB5CDZNENIZ57WBATJWZB8AAAZ0Y	It would be interesting to know the density of the material, the temperature at which the experiment was performed, and to include a control group with only water, in order to compare it with the water with vinegar, which is the acidic water.

es_31LM9EDVON5VKMUZUUSVJHJV3MFNJL	I would need to know what type of wood, plastic, etc. was used in the experiment. 2. I would need to know what vinegar was used by the student3. I would need to know if the initial mass will affect the final results to know if I have to use the same initial masses.
es_31LM9EDVON5VKMUZUUSVJHJVVCBJNL	1. In addition to vinegar, we need another acidic reference medium to measure how the materials react with it. The suggestion is to use lemon juice, because it is an acidic medium that is safe to handle. Let's test the same materials in lemon juice as we did with vinegar. \n2. We need a neutral reference medium to measure the influence of non-acidic rain on the materials. Tap water can be used for this. You can measure its pH level and if necessary, add some acid or hydroxide until its pH is neutral. Add samples of these four materials in neutral water, as was done with vinegar and as would be done with lemon juice. A data needed to measure the resistance of the material to acid rain is the percentage of degradation to the acid medium, which would be the final mass minus the initial mass and the difference of that subtraction is divided by the initial mass and multiplied by 100. To ensure correct mass measurement, it is recommended to use a hand balance rather than an electronic scale.
es_31Q0U3WYDRSZMKM8OY50JK1J18B71J	Use a high-precision balance for accurate measurement results. \For materials such as limestone or marble, do not use too small samples as they may dissolve completely in contact with vinegar after 24 hours. For drying, samples should rest in a dry environment to avoid moisture reabsorption.
es_31Q0U3WYDRSZMKM8OY50JK1J19S712	I would need more samples, their initial mass, and difference between masses.
es_31Q0U3WYDRSZMKM8OY50JK1J1IW71O	The group must declare the type of wood and plastic used as there are different types of wood from different tree species and plastics of different elasticity (such as PVC). The temperature of the environment must be declared and controlled so that the experiment can be repeated. Also the brand of vinegar must be declared.
es_31QNSG6A5T6HXK6TNJEFYUORPHQ78S	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the environmental conditions in which the experiment was conducted.nI would also need to know the type of vinegar used in the experiment (acidity).nI would also need to know the type of sample material used. For example, the limestone used could be composed of a different proportion of minerals so the results could vary, as well as using another type of wood or plastic, etc.
es_31Z0PCVWUMS0V4YHQHPAPQKET7DT7L	The student should measure the weight of the sample before settling for 30 minutes and drying and measure the weight again after the samples have settled for 30 minutes and dried.
es_31Z0PCVWUMS0V4YHQHPAPQKEYRV7TQ	The experiment is complete and requires no additional information. The extra tests to be performed would be a tare of the extracted liquid and a dilution of the extracted liquid to verify that the corroded material is present.

es_32SCWG5HIJHJZCR5QQBYE2JL9RW6PE	Some important information would be the type of vinegar used, the amount of vinegar in each container and the temperature at the time of the experiment.
es_32SVAV9L3HMDFPYLI5V3H4I601DA3P	Acid rain is produced by the interaction of certain gases emitted into the air by industries (such as sulfurous oxide and nitrous oxide) as they mix with raindrops falling into the atmosphere. 1) Since there is more than one substance that produces such acid rain, it is convenient to do the experiment using at least a second acidic agent in addition to vinegar. That agent could be the juice of a lemon, also acidic like vinegar and safe to handle. Samples of the same materials can then be placed in lemon juice and the experiment and measurements repeated. 2) it is also necessary to have a pH neutral element (like water) to compare the influence of an acidic environment on the surfaces with the influence of a neutral environment, so you can make samples of the materials and put them in containers with water, the same as already done with vinegar and lemon juice. 3) Another data from the experiment that would be useful is the daily degradation percentage, which is calculated as the difference between the initial mass of each object and the final mass, divide that subtraction by the initial mass and multiply it by 100. As the time frame of the experiment is 24 hours, this percentage would be of the daily type. 4) If mass loss occurs with the objects immersed in water, this could indicate that the air at the site of the experiment is slightly acidic and the level of acidity could be measured by comparing with the acidity levels of the other substances. 5) it is important that, as far as possible, the mass of the samples is calculated with a manual balance and not with electronic scales.
es_32UTUBMZ7I92A85W8T15VAUV9E8VB5	We need the Density of each element tested. Amount of Vinegar used in each sample, expressed in Volume. Area or surface of the container used,

es_32ZKVD547H0IYZ3DOJVZCF2CIJU3B9	I see that in the experiment you want to see how the materials react to the vinegar and how much of it dissolves. I think the experiment is very clear, maybe you should specify what size of container is necessary, although as long as the 4 containers are the same and the sample fits it should be enough. It would also be good to know how much vinegar to add. The measurements are not given so I assume that it will be the same amount in all the containers and that it will be enough to submerge the sample. Finally, could you specify how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and for how long.
es_333U7HK6IBSMYA3M50ESNC71PPZDJT	According to this table, four different samples and their masses in this section the highest mass is wood is 0.0 and the lowest is limestone is -1.3 is very low and the whole table is plastic is -0.1 and mormol is -0.4, so the whole table contains the mass.
es_336KAV9KYS5PQP05UBVE1GVLZ7QY2A	The type of wood would have to be known to replicate this experiment, especially if a wood varnish was used.

es_37FMASSAYE4XO2LW9M2MGL4110FBI3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what kind of plastic was used since there are several kinds such as PVC, LDPE (found in plastic bags), etc. Different kinds of plastics will react differently to vinegar. The temperature at which the material is dried must be the same. It must be determined whether it will be in the open air, in a temperature controlled room, or in a cooler. I would not recommend open air as this would be a variable outside the control of the group. It is also necessary to determine how long the samples will be under distilled water. In short, you need to state more controlled variables such as temperature, type of materials, and the length of time they are under distilled water.

es_3C2NJ6JBKCUVEQWRN9M3K0XEYZG2N9	To begin with, to replicate this experiment the only thing we would need to do would be to change the elements to perform tests that are different and get results that show significant changes in their mass. Initially, we could use elements such as cardboard, icopor, glass and brick to take samples that we can put in test tubes (they are cheap) to which we would add vinegar in order not to change the liquid with which the experiment is being done or put other liquids such as soda, cleaning liquids (clorox-bleach) and rainwater to know the different effects of these liquids in each material. It is also important to have the elements for the measurement of the samples to be used and thus have the initial data and the final data. It would be advisable to perform this experiment in a place where nobody can move it and where the temperature does not have a major variation so that the samples are always stable and there is no major effect on it when the results are reviewed. This procedure, as can be seen in the previous experiment, must be built and left for 24 hours so that the liquid has an effect on the material being tested. I would add data such as: Resistance of the material.

es_3D4CH1LGEC604I04LEON43WV7UD9GF	"Acid rainAcid rain is a form of acid pollution, which refers to the fall (deposition) of acids present in the atmosphere through rain, fog and snow (also known as wet deposition).nThe main precursors of acids are sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are emitted by thermoelectric power plants, internal combustion engines of cars and airplanes, and some other industries, as a product of the combustion of fuels containing small percentages of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N), such as coal, natural gas, gas oil, petroleum, etc.nAcids, mainly sulfuric acid and nitric acid, dissolve in the water droplets that form clouds and in the raindrops themselves, and are deposited on the ground. Both acids originate in the atmosphere when sulfur trioxide (SO3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) react with water, oxygen and other chemicals present in the atmosphere. In the presence of sunlight, the rate of most of these reactions increases.nThere is also another form of acid pollution known as dry deposition, which refers to acidic gases and particles that are carried by the wind, hitting buildings, cars, houses and trees. Another way of entrainment is heavy rainfall. In this case acidic substances are incorporated into acid rain, which contributes to its acidity.nApproximately half of the acidic substances in the atmosphere fall to the ground through dry deposition processes.nHow is acid rain measured?nAcid rain is measured according to the ""pH"" scale, hydrogen potential. The lower the pH of a substance, the more acidic it is.nPure water has a pH of 7.0 and rain normally has a pH between 5 and 6, i.e., it is slightly acidic, carrying carbonic acid that forms when carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in the falling water. On the other hand, in areas where the atmosphere is polluted by these acidifying substances, the rain has pH values of up to 4 or 3 and, in some areas where the fog is acidic, the pH can reach 2 or 3, i.e. similar to that of lemon juice or vinegar.nWhat are the effects of acid rain?nThe effects caused by acidic water will depend on several factors, such as the degree of acidity of the water, the chemical composition of the soil and its buffering capacity, as well as the characteristics of the living organisms affected.nAcid deposition contributes to the lowering of pH in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and allows the mobilization of toxic metals, especially aluminum. This causes a variety of effects, such as damage to forests and soils, fish and other living things, building materials and human health. Acid rain also acts to reduce visibility.n In forests, acid rain causes damage by decomposing soil nutrients, hindering the natural growth of trees. The damage can extend to grassland pastures, harming livestock, and to lakes, potentially killing large numbers of fish.n The effects of acid rain on soil can be magnified in high mountain forests, where fog contributes significant amounts of acid pollutants.n Acid rain contributes to the degradation of building and art materials (stone disease) and metal corrosion. Monuments and buildings are sensitive to the action of acid rain. Many ruins have disappeared or are about to disappear because of this factor.nHarm to people is mainly indirect, through the consumption of fish and drinking water contaminated by acid rain.nHow can acid rain be reduced?nTo reduce acid rain, it is necessary to reduce the emission of the chemical compounds that give rise to acids, i.e., acid precursors, which are mainly sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (nitrogen monoxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2).Today, SO2 formation can be reduced by removing sulfur from fossil fuels or by trapping SOx before it is emitted into the atmosphere, through chemical reactions that transform it into less reactive chemical species. The use of catalytic converters reduces the formation of NO and NO2 by reducing these oxides to N2 and O2."

es_3E47SOBEYS9GY7D2NMYHR5AJMCOCI5	good day, taking into account that vinegar is a chemical composition of acid tro can cause a reaction between the materials exposed to the experiment. 1) the vinegar in the marble. as we all know the marble is the composition of limestone rocks, and as we all know what happens when we take a rock and add water it disintegrates. the same happens with the marble although we must take into account the acidity of the vinegar. and the hardness of the marble for that reason the loss of mass was not greater, 2) with respect to the limestone rocks as already mentioned before a rose is more prone to wear and tear for that reason it is noticed in the samples that the loss is greater than that of marble. 3) in the case of wood it absorbs vinegar as you all know and the mass increases but when it is left to rest it returns to its initial mass since it dries so there is no difference between the initial and final mass. 4) the practical one used worldwide like stored of all matter in liquid state also suffered a small and insgnificant wear product of the time that acted in acid of the viander inside the container. i hope that it has seemed to you well my opinion and i hope that you qualify positive.

es_3PH3VY7DJNAB7V8H4HM43UKC7E2ZW7	Something additional and necessary to replicate the experiment is to know how much vinegar they used. Specifically, how many liters of vinegar were used for each material, and if it was consistent. Another necessary data to replicate the experiment is to know the initial mass of the starting material, where the samples for the experiment were obtained. We also need to know what the containers were like, what they were made of and where they were stored. Finally, it is necessary to know if they had a control for each material, to make sure that the initial mass is not so different from the final mass without the use of vinegar.

For the reaction to be tight, the kerosene has to contribute carbon and hydrogen in the same proportion as the methane (see figure). The classical explanation looks at the left side of this reaction to say that the oxygen disappears as the reaction proceeds, until it is exhausted and only nitrogen remains (4/5 of the original amount, due to the composition of the air)."

es_3VSOLARPKDMZA6OGQZH3L97MUII39O	The purpose of the experiment is not very well understood. If I understand correctly, you are trying to simulate the effect of acid rain on different materials using vinegar. The samples are initially weighed, then immersed in vinegar to simulate erosion, and finally we measure the masses to see how much of the material was lost. To reproduce the experiment, I think we would need to know more about the vinegar containers. It would be necessary to specify the size of the containers and the amount of vinegar to be used (at least approximate), or the proportion with the sample to be used. It would be necessary to know what type of vinegar is used, that is to say to indicate its density with precision. The density of the materials is also useful data. This is important because if the density of the vinegar is lower than that of the samples, the samples will go to the bottom of the vessel. In turn, the depth of the vessel affects the pressure on the samples if they sink. It is also important to know the initial temperature of the vinegar bath. If it is not specified, it is understood that it is at room temperature, or standard temperature, i.e. 25 degrees C. Perhaps it would be important to calculate the relative mass lost by each sample, i.e. the ratio between its final and initial mass. Especially since the samples do not all have the same initial mass.
