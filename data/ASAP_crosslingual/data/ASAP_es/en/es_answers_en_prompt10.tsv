es_3018Q3ZVOK35YRJNTVWZZ2LMBENRA7	white :: The experiment shows that the lighter the color, the lower the temperature inside the kennel, therefore to offer a more tolerable temperature to the dog during daylight hours, the white color will favor a cool temperature inside the kennel.
es_3018Q3ZVOK35YRJNTVWZZ2LMDXXAR4	white :: white can leave the house at a lower temperature, as it does not increase the temperature as much as the other colors.
es_304SM51WA5HMIGOSEYW0KNAOI0CSBJ	white :: The big house is coming into view
es_308Q0PEVBAQE096ZB2OQPF9BKSU9I0	light gray :: According to this table, the four different tables black, dark gray, light gray white My choice is light griss because it is perfect for house painting.
es_308XBLVESKHAH1OFZ9WVUD5SV4ABR6	white :: The color white becomes the lowest temperature inside the house.  The experiment supports this conclusion because the temperature inside the pot was lower with white compared to the other colors (black, gray, etc.).  So, when it is hot, white is the best color for a house for me but because it reflects more light when it is hot.
es_30H4UDGLT4VLOFCXD6IF3YG74D7PMG	white :: The darker the color used for the doghouse, the warmer the doghouse will be because dark colors absorb more energy. As seen in the results of the experiment, the lighter the color, the lower the temperature inside. So since the lighter color is white, then it is the preferred color because it will result in the most comfortable temperature possible for the dog.
es_30IQTZXKAMJTUA7HAS5YZEVX1AY0XN	white :: Based on the results, the kennel should be white because it will keep the kennel cooler and the dog will not overheat.
es_30LB5CDZNENIZ57WBATJWZB87AM0Z8	black :: I choose black because it will increase the temperature of the air inside a boat and we will see how it affects the colors.
es_30X31N5D653HZ6J08KW4PCQISR8ASX	white :: white absorbs less light and therefore the temperature inside the house will rise less.
es_30ZX6P7VFA8ZV0568BUBRTGXKAC2JR	white :: The white color can help to lower the temperature inside the cassette, this is good in hot climates. As you can see the average temperature with the white lid is the lowest of all the darker colored lids.
es_30ZX6P7VFA8ZV0568BUBRTGXKD0J22	light gray :: It would give more luminosity to the house and would maintain a cooler environment inside the house.
es_317HQ483I95ZPBATCC7V7G4VP67INI	black :: The black color could affect the inside of the house because dark colors absorb more energy. In the tests the black color had the highest results because it absorbs more energy. The average of the black color is 53.
es_3180JW2OT6PRUXOTQUW9P0J965QJ54	white :: A white kennel should make the temperature inside the kennel less affected by the outside. That is to say, if it is very hot outside, the dog will feel more comfortable inside the kennel. If it is cold, since there is no heat source outside, it would be the same if it were black, since it would not be warmer anyway.
es_3180JW2OT6PRUXOTQUW9P0J98C25JI	white :: The general formula is that dark color absorbs heat, so, according to this phenomenon, black color will increase heat.
es_31EUONYN2XGMT2U5CY6R1UUUG7WOVV	light gray :: To give a more precise answer, it would be necessary to know the material of the building, but a priori, based on the same theorem contained in the exercise, that is, considering that dark colors absorb more energy, and we do not know if the building is in an area of extreme heat or extreme cold, it is best to opt for a neutral response, which gives the greatest possible warmth in winter and the least possible heat in summer.
es_31JLPPHS2W72HTSMSO0LIZ2BT8DO3I	white :: The white color would affect the inside of the house because lighter colors do not absorb as much energy as darker colors such as black.
es_31JLPPHS2W72HTSMSO0LIZ2BURA3OX	white :: The white color does not absorb as much heat as the other colors, and it would be better if the kennel does not heat up so much so that the dog does not suffer from the summer heat.
es_31LM9EDVON5VKMUZUUSVJHJV26QJNV	white :: I chose white so that the temperature would be pleasant both in the winter and in the summer.
es_31LVTDXBL9NMUAARQMLP8G1X1WARLL	black :: Use psychological effects of black to create an elegant and bold look for your home. If you use it wisely, black lends an elegant and sophisticated air to interior design. If set against a light or neutral background color, everything that is black will stand out. Black is ideal for highlighting certain things in a room. Most people associate black with death, mourning, widowhood and generally with formal and serious occasions. In conclusion, do not use too much black, but only to highlight certain things such as picture frames, small tables, etc.
es_31LVTDXBL9NMUAARQMLP8G1X2TCRLI	black :: THIS EXPERIMENT CAUSED TO CONCLUDE THE INSIDE WAS ALSO TOO MUCH BY THIS LAMP AND ITS HIGHER TEMPERATURE. THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE INTERIOR WAS AFFECTED.
es_31Q0U3WYDRSZMKM8OY50JK1J80W71V	dark gray :: According to this table, the four different tables black, dark gray, light gray white My choice is light griss because it is perfect for house painting.
es_31QNSG6A5T6HXK6TNJEFYUORGDU87G	white :: The white color reflects more light, so the temperature will not increase too much when the dog is in the kennel during hot weather.
es_31UV0MXWNSPVZM4N8CB9DZ49WBL5I7	white :: It is the color that would heat the interior of the kennel the least, since the experiment confirms the initial hypothesis that the darker the color the more energy it absorbs. With the white kennel, the dog would have a cooler shelter on sunny days.
es_326O153BMKBENUHURZ31QWU9F01ED4	dark gray :: Dark gray can help use less energy no matter what time of day the building is exposed to the sun. Air conditioners or heaters need a lot of electrical current to keep a space at a stable temperature during the day and night. If all tests started with a temperature of 24C and consequently temperatures were recorded after different times, the gray color was not affected no matter how long the lid was exposed to light creating heat. This can be compared to the sunlight on a building and the hours the building is exposed to the sun.
es_32EYX73OY2MPD0XLZ0DQZ3XGEKEURN	white :: With the incidence of heat the temperature does not rise as much as the other colors.
es_32KTQ2V7RFS0WSWQWHMIH8GS19NM9I	white :: The white color would make the house increase in temperature as little as possible, with an average of 42ยบ.
es_32KTQ2V7RFS0WSWQWHMIH8GSU9M9MX	black :: Because your dog would like to be warm, black is the best color for the kennel. The results of the experiment show that black absorbs more energy, because the temperature of the black cover increased more.
es_32M8BPYGAVZTFJT7P8U0HWVYIFDIG2	white :: White would keep the house temperature much cooler all year round. As shown in the graph above, it is the coolest temperature on all scales. White has a high albedo, which means it will keep temperatures cool.
es_32RIADZISUH2XH3JZJMDC94I07D4SX	white :: The white color reduces the heating by the sun inside the kennel and the dog will be more comfortable.
es_32RIADZISUH2XH3JZJMDC94I08B4SX	white :: By painting the house white, there would not be such a high temperature increase inside the house if it is exposed to intense sunlight or artificial light.
es_32SCWG5HIJHJZCR5QQBYE2JL9DO6PE	white :: The white color reflects less heat inside the house, therefore the house should be painted with white color to reduce the temperature inside the house.
es_32SVAV9L3HMDFPYLI5V3H4I671K3AW	black :: The black color will make the temperature of the air inside the canister higher, the experiment proves that his hypothesis was correct since the temperature was higher so it does absorb more energy.
es_32UTUBMZ7I92A85W8T15VAUVA57BV3	light gray :: The light gray color would cause the temperature inside the house to rise, but not that much. The results of the experiment say that if the color is black the temperature rises more than twice the initial temperature, but light gray is a little less than twice the initial temperature.
es_32ZKVD547H0IYZ3DOJVZCF2CL9U3BS	white :: The house will remain less warm because of the white color. It will not absorb as much sun.
es_32ZKVD547H0IYZ3DOJVZCF2CNTK3BO	white :: By using the white color, the temperature inside the kennel will remain cooler and more pleasant for the dog.
es_336YQZE83XRHV5UETR915SBQC7QM5Y	white :: Based on the results, the lighter the color, the less energy it absorbs. The white color temperature is lower than the black color.
es_337RC3OW07FENHR8Z6QZ9DQ0M1BVL4	white :: According to the experiment, the colors of objects affect the temperature of the spaces they contain, demonstrating that light colors such as white slow down the heating of the air contained in an object, as opposed to dark colors such as black which accelerate the heating of the air contained in an object.
es_338JKRMM28CS9X5KXQK5LYJGR9LAH0	white :: According to the experiment, white was the color that maintained the lowest air temperature, compared to the other colors, gray, dark gray or black. So if you want to maintain a cool temperature in the house, I would opt for white.
es_33CID571066UB8PPFWKTQIYHUEG3L6	white :: The white color will affect the kennel by reflecting sunlight and therefore keeping the interior at a cool temperature, without the possible risk of overheating the air and suffocating the animal. As can be seen in the table, the white color presents the lowest temperature results while, as the darkness of the color increases, the temperature increases as well, reaching up to 54ยบC.
es_33CKWXB73LXLBY76ZIORIAA6YV711U	white :: White materials will reflect more light energy and heat than those of a darker color. Therefore, a construction made of lighter materials will have a lower interior temperature than a construction made of dark materials. This is clearly demonstrated in the experiment, as the canister with the white top reached an average temperature of only 42ยฐC in the three repeated experiments. The canister with the black top, however, reached 53 C in three experiments. The canisters with light gray and dark gray tops were intermediate temperatures as expected.
es_33F859I568QXS7AC34K1G93M3X8BH4	white :: It is demonstrated by the experiment that the objects painted in white is the one that least increases its temperature inside them, as it only increased by 18 ยฐC during the exposure and considering that it will be a house for a dog, which is more difficult to regulate its temperature, it is more convenient that it does not increase too much.
es_33FOTY3KEOY5Y1H4FFDBZ6TX3JA1CF	white :: With the white lid the air temperature inside the canister obtained the lowest values in all tests. Therefore, it is assumed that in a house it would obtain similar results.
es_33ISQZVXPRZPL4R2VC2VG2CO716CCR	light gray :: DEPENDING ON THE CLIMATE IT IS GOOD TO KNOW WHAT IS THE BEST TEMPERATURE FOR THE PUPPY , ALSO THE DISTANCE FROM THE LAMP IS ALSO A DETERMINANT FACTOR , I WOULD PUT A NEUTRAL COLOR WHERE THE TEMPERATURE DOES NOT HAVE SO MUCH VARIATION !!! !!!
es_33ISQZVXPRZPL4R2VC2VG2CO728CCV	white :: Light energy can be absorbed or reflected. Dark surfaces and objects absorb light and convert it into heat energy, making the temperature of that object feel warmer. The goal of our kennel is to prevent as much heat transfer as possible to keep our puppy cool. By keeping the heat in, we are making the interior cooler. The white kennel reflects more light than darker colors. The white kennel should be the coolest inside. The black kennel absorbs the most light, and this energy is transferred inside the kennel over time and warms the interior.
es_33IZTU6J83ETVJRTJUOI9K1G1MUXST	white :: The white color keeps the air temperature inside the house very cool.
es_33IZTU6J83ETVJRTJUOI9K1GXNVSXN	white :: white absorbs heat and for this reason it is the best color for house paint. As you can see the air temperatures with white are the best.
es_33LKR6A5KGXMKIJF1181OGT1VA71T9	white :: white is the ideal color because too much heat for the dog is never good.
es_33PPUNGG3AI6ZZRV5NCYGVCVMHIZR6	white :: Based on the information provided in the table, white is the color that absorbs the least heat and keeps the temperature below 45 degrees Celsius according to the results. White is the best choice for Brandi and Jerry.
es_33TIN5LC06N0Q9L4FKATB33ZAK99Y5	white :: The white color would make the inside of the house cooler than the other colors. According to the data, the white color decreases the internal temperature more than the other colors.
es_33UKMF931BXNT2VO3KSBUMCWQO2TT7	white :: white color because it absorbs less heat energy, therefore the temperature inside the house will be lower.
es_34BBWHLWHCOPC5J74DYI3ZHMF5OWI7	white :: In a warm place, with a lot of sun, a light or white color would make the temperature inside the house as low as possible, with a difference of up to 12ยบ with respect to a black color.  Depending on the location of the house, it could also be interesting to paint it in a dark color, to increase this temperature.
es_34FNN24DCOMHPMJSCUXCZNYXHNO5YZ	black :: According to the tests that were made, it is evident that the black color increased significantly more the temperature than the other colors. This is because the darker the color, the more energy absorption the object of that color has.
es_34FNN24DCOMHPMJSCUXCZNYXHZGY58	white :: The white color does not absorb as much energy, so the building will not trap as much heat. It is a good choice if Jerry and Brandi live in a very hot climate. If it is for cold weather, black would be more efficient and ideal.
es_34FNN24DCOMHPMJSCUXCZNYXLCB5Y4	white :: The white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer.
es_34HJIJKLP79IP9KNTERINWOPZAPV49	white :: White repels more energy than dark colors so using a white roof seems to be the best measure to keep the doghouse at a lower temperature.
es_34HJIJKLP79IP9KNTERINWOPZILV4L	blanco :: El color blanco mantendrรญa la casa mรกs fresca, no absorbe tanto la energรญa como el color blanco.(White would be best for the dog house, it would keep the house fresher since white does not absorb as much energy as black)
es_34MAJL3QP60YD0I494LC41W681F34P	light gray :: with this color an average temperature of about 45 degrees can be presented according to the experiment table provided. Perhaps an adequate temperature for a dog and considering that the light in the test does the function of the sun...
es_34PGFRQONQOL7G3DMVJIF0WMPE7WJY	white :: the white color makes the temperature inside the house lower.
es_34Q075JO1ZQL49MO3ZKR45RWT4110T	white :: Because dark colors absorb more energy and heat the air inside the building, choosing to paint it white will result in a cooler building.
es_34QN5IT0T143F9692KT6JFE477Y805	white :: The white color is the only one that kept a temperature of 43 oh less, the white color is the one that absorbs less heat from the sun. It is more convenient to have a white house so that it does not retain as much heat during the summer.
es_34QN5IT0T143F9692KT6JFE4CUG08U	white :: According to the results of the experiment. The white cover is the one that insulates or reflects the heat emitted by the lamp. So a kennel for the pet should have a roof of that color, if what you are looking for is that the dog is comfortable. However, it should be defined if the kennel will be used in temperate or winter climates.
es_34S9DKFK752LFBPYGUTYT4YJEU6YNE	white :: Dark colors absorb more energy, according to the results of this study. White absorbs less energy and as a result is less warm and the inside of the doghouse would be cooler and less hot.
es_34T446B1C2R5RCWMJW9BL1AN5TW0CE	white :: Because if you make the paint in the black color it will be too hot inside. The white color is better because the temperature will be kept lower.
es_34V1S5K3GUEY7PBY91F1SCJ64DX96L	light gray :: I would choose light gray because in summer it would not be so hot and in winter it would not be ideal but at least it is not as cold as it could be with white, the blacker the color chosen, the warmer the house will be.
es_34V1S5K3GUEY7PBY91F1SCJ683896G	white :: As expected with this experiment, the data collected show that dark colors absorb more energy than light colors. The white color absorbs the least radiation. The white house will have the lowest temperature increase when exposed to the sun.
es_34X6J5FLPVBGNJ7RAMKCNBE03JPQJ1	white :: The white color or light colors in general make the kennel have less temperature and since we are building a kennel for a dog, the ideal is that it is of a light color, so that the animal has the most pleasant temperature possible. If we used a dark color the temperature would increase to more than double the outside temperature, as is reflected in the experiment with the lamp.
es_351SEKWQS2UCZI978XRK34ZILU7MDX	white :: The white color will maintain the temperature of the house at a lower temperature than any of the other colors. In all three tests, white was always the color that achieved the lowest temperature.
es_352YTHGROXQD78P3OPAE8VXGV0S4HK	black :: Black
es_352YTHGROXQD78P3OPAE8VXGYDI4H3	white :: This color will ensure that the temperature inside the house is not too high, especially in the summer.
es_354P56DE9MGZG4L21HKKFLOSR8H7SW	white :: based on the experiment, I would say that white is the right color since it does not absorb much energy.
es_354P56DE9MGZG4L21HKKFLOSSBAS7H	blanco :: Blanco
es_358010RM5G69NB8XDPTNK7LNS8OXVQ	white :: The temperature inside the house should be lower than with any of the other colors.
es_358010RM5G69NB8XDPTNK7LNU96XVC	white :: The best color for the kennel is white, because it makes the temperature of the kennel lower. Because the dog is a living being, we want it to be at a comfortable temperature.
es_35GMH2SV3GU5RR8JH8HH1Q68MYXOE7	black :: I think the color is more full of mediums, they are greener than the others.
es_35H6S234SCDF629M6B2KGWE4IGZ65A	white :: The white color will keep the temperature in the house lower than a dark color.
es_35H6S234SCDF629M6B2KGWE4KN356T	white :: the temperatures obtained by using the white color are the lowest, but they range from 41 to 43 degrees Celsius, which is a very high temperature for a dog to be in a kennel.
es_35K3O9HUADQBLEVQI5YREWXUOC5FEZ	white :: In the experiment, the white lid was the one that resulted in a lower temperature inside the pot. Therefore, if the house is painted white, its inside temperature will not increase as much as with one of the other colors.
es_35K3O9HUADQBLEVQI5YREWXUP47FEM	white :: By using white color the temperature inside the house will be kept cooler than if dark colors are used.
es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAWKVHUF	white :: Undoubtedly the best color is white because it will absorb less heat than darker colors. White could be a good color to use because in summer, when temperatures are usually high, the house will not increase its temperature excessively. This is because light hitting light surfaces is reflected, while light hitting dark colors is absorbed. This explains why in our experiment, the darker the color, the higher the temperature inside the container.
es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAXOPUHV	blanco :: CONSIDER TO BANOS
es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAY8YHUW	white :: Using a white lid will ensure that it is not so hot inside the kennel. In the experiment, the glass jar with white lid only reached 42 degrees, while the glass jar with black lid reached 53 degrees, so it would be better for the dog if I use the white lid. It would be cooler.
es_36AHBNMV1TPCTZYLR0FVXZMPX0PDYD	white :: The best color for your dog's kennel is white, because it has the lowest temperatures, with an average of 42ยบC.
es_36H9ULYP647JWUHIW69IBCAMTDUJF3	dark gray :: The best color would be dark gray because although the temperature rises more than with white, with gray it remains constant, which will also serve for the winter months by not cooling as quickly.
es_36H9ULYP647JWUHIW69IBCAMTEDFJK	white :: The hypothesis of the experiment was tested: darker colors absorb more heat, and so it turns out that the inside of the pot got hotter with the black lid than with the dark gray lid, and the dark gray lid got hotter than the pot with the light gray lid, and so on. If I were designing a kennel for a dog, I would want to give it a lighter color so that the inside would heat up as little as possible.
es_36NEMU28XHQB8O9YPSWAVSO3SL7MWM	white :: since dark colors absorb more energy by placing the white color we are allowing a lower temperature inside the house.
es_36PW28KO419GPNEI7PCZ0VM3Y8NEAB	light gray :: Light gray because after the three tests and the last one with average it comes out as the best.
es_36TFCYNS46N45ADD80CJ56UEKQQHXR	white :: The booth temperature would be lower because white attracts less energy.
es_36V4Q8R5ZMD6ORDCDJX4336H4CPMQ1	white :: This color would absorb less energy and the temperature would not be so hot, therefore it is more essential for the dog to adapt to its new home. If it were dark, the kennel would absorb more energy and the kennel would heat up faster and the poor dog would get sick with how hot it can get.
es_36V4Q8R5ZMD6ORDCDJX4336H4HQQMG	white :: Painting the house white helps most of the sun's radiation to be reflected to the outside, and that makes the house material less hot and less heat to pass into the house, which makes it cooler and reduces the chance that the dog will want to leave the house and go into the owners' house. In the experiment, the white lid allowed the inside of the can to heat up as little as possible, indicating that the white paint would allow the house to heat up less than the other colors.
es_36V4Q8R5ZMD6ORDCDJX4336HB55QME	white :: color will reflect light better
es_36W0OB37HYRTA5DS9I042RAPVW9ZH6	blanco :: BLANCO IS PERFEACT FOR BEST ONE
es_36ZN444YTTBH7WA5DR78M540B2TIOI	black :: the black color maintained the highest temperature.
es_373ERPL3YQLADNIWZVNGU7BEZYRRT1	White :: According to the experiments, white color is more efficient than other colors, which helps to keep the interior of the house to stay cool. Every experiment result shows that it absorbs less heat than others.
es_374TNBHA8D86I82QWMLFXYTOJW4QYM	white :: It is not about increasing temperature, it is about light absorption and reflection. The color that has a high wavelength absorbs more light and is converted into heat, while low wavelength colors reflect the lights.
es_379J5II41QTXL65M4G1P992EQEWLEW	white :: The darker the color of the house, the less the air temperature inside the house increases.  If the sun is shining and it is hot outside, the inside of a white house will maintain a lower temperature than a grey or black house.  Of course, if we are talking about cold weather, it is probably better to choose black to increase the temperature inside the house.
es_37C0GNLMHHGAAFOFLHK3E82WVUND69	black :: The black color would affect in a positive way because the air temperature would be the highest with the black color.
es_37Q970SNZGLL5I60C13BEBXFQASS19	white :: The white color will be better for your dog because it will increase the temperature less than the black color or the others. As the hypothesis says, the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs and makes it warmer.
es_37Q970SNZGLL5I60C13BEBXFSGW1S0	black :: this is how it happens.
es_37TD41K0AJM5SLGYSYSVV7G6ZRPCSY	white :: White was the color that generated the least temperature rise, therefore it is the most suitable color to paint the kennel, so the dog will not be subjected to an excessively high temperature.
es_37W3JXSD68LB25YC8VKLPNBA8R9WY9	white :: As it is not a dark color, it will help to reduce the heat inside the kennel. However, it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of the dog, how furry it is.
es_37WLF8U1WR3IOLUPDY6QILXMF3X6KS	white :: it would be cooler, it would be less hot. greetings.
es_37ZHEEHM6YZVWN0NB2JJ7DGG2KG37L	white :: According to the results, white is the color that best resists external heat and therefore should be used for the roof of the house.
es_384PI804XUELYTLIGIZB06E5MVS0SB	light gray :: The light gray would be the best because the two darker ones would make that with the amount of light that there is in summer the amount of heat inside the house would be very large, however, in winter, when there is less light the white one would fall short to give the amount of light sufficient to heat the house well.
es_386PBUZZXHA5WMREIHCG6PF6QDSLJU	light gray :: There is a classic home experiment that consists of putting a candle on a plate with a ... There are three phenomena that occur inside the glass while the candle burns: ... Therefore the water rises to fill that gap, 1/5 of the original volume. ... As can be seen in the experiment, the pressure does not vary ...
es_38F5OAUN5PPAQV7MQN8LB7HQQQCH7R	white :: looks lighter
es_38SKSKU7R3A91B780ZRGUO06FXVLIA	black :: You can make the environment darker at a certain point of view.
es_38YMOXR4MWC9JLO62CPT6WRH6AW6WI	black :: In fact, the black color attracts more light particles (photons), which makes its thermal attraction increase faster and its thermal gradient will also be higher.
es_38YMOXR4MWC9JLO62CPT6WRH76YW63	white :: The white color helps to keep the house temperature lower. To check this, it is sufficient to see the table with the average temperatures.
es_392CY0QWG34D330NU7SZ87YVRD6I4M	light gray :: light gray 46
es_39ASUFLU6ZKSL0MBIZ4DK3X1SA6XEZ	white :: White does not absorb heat, therefore, it will help keep the room cooler.
es_39JEC7537WELKDX2MTX06U0DRVXCVA	dark gray :: dark gray is more stable
es_39JEC7537WELKDX2MTX06U0DW6PVCC	white :: I like white very much. It is a very pure and beautiful color for the soul and eyes.
es_39KFRKBFIP83XWPAH9TB8TYO2Q3YOR	white :: With a white painted kennel, the dog will be subjected to less extreme temperatures on days of intense sunshine.
es_39LNWE0K4W9CK1U29DJHLBWPXTVUIZ	white :: White would be the ideal color for the doghouse as it experiences the lowest temperature increase according to the experiment.
es_39LOEL67OUIZW156L7BPLDCBBFA38G	light gray :: it is very obvious it can be affected in a drastic way besides it is all common my opinion is clear and scientific it is my beredict it is true this light and its conponents
es_39LOEL67OUIZW156L7BPLDCBEE583H	white :: BALNCO'S COLOR IS VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT IS MINGLE IN TEST 42,43 IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE COMBINATION AND PRUBA 3 OF 41 IS ALSO SHINING OF THE RESULT, AND ITS PERFECT DOG COLOR AND MEASURE OF 42 IS VERY BEAUTIFUL OF THE DOG.
es_39O5D9O87V5184VJ2JRUNZ8U1DLC3Z	dark gray :: Of all the colors used in the experiment, it is the one that provides a medium temperature, so it will be suitable for both hot and cold external temperature conditions.
es_39RP059MEJ6JKLBNU10E8EBIPS8BM1	white :: The higher the temperature, the greater the discomfort in the environment.
es_39U1BHVTDN4IULXUO5MKC98YOWU3TB	white :: White does not absorb light as much as the other colors, but rather reflects it.  When light is not absorbed, then it does not heat up as much. That is why experiments with white paint have the lowest temperatures.
es_39ZSFO5CAA98FCE8RV4HXCBP358JUB	white :: If Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, the most appropriate color is white, since the inside temperature of the house will not rise as much during sunny days and may stay a little cooler. If they paint the kennel a dark color, the livability of the kennel in the summer may become unbearable. The other option is that if Brandi and Jerry live in a colder, less sunny climate then it would be better to paint the house black so that in the winter on sunny days the house can maintain a slightly warmer interior temperature.
es_3A0EX8ZRNA1JE201D4OP29YPUUFYBN	light gray :: Suppose I decide to grow soybean sprouts in my kitchen, near the window. I sow some soybean seeds in a pot with soil, put them on the windowsill and wait for them to germinate. However, after several weeks, there is no germination. Why? Well... it turns out that I forgot to water the seeds.
es_3A4NIXBJ78CVXUXZLEP8MH7NW3DLMI	black :: The house would be warmer inside if it were black. The results of the experiment support this conclusion because it shows that the darker the color of the lid, the more the air temperature inside the glass jar will increase.
es_3A4NIXBJ78CVXUXZLEP8MH7NYWSLML	white :: The experiment shows that the lighter the color, the less heat accumulates inside. Therefore, the best color for the roof of the doghouse is white. However, the minimum temperature reached in the experiment (41ยฐC) is too high for a living being to withstand for a prolonged period of time.
es_3A4TN5196MVG2C2IH4GWRT94JAAHC1	white :: The most appropriate color would be white, because it is the color that maintains the lowest temperature, using the other colors of the experiment would make the house very hot.
es_3A9AA95ATYZNG8RRL71TMW5LFGUP5W	white :: Thanks to the experiment it can be observed that the white color is the best choice because, after 10 min exposed to the lamp this color absorbs less heat than the dark colors.
es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV072O6O	white :: During the hot and sunny seasons the optimal color to use would be white because after doing the experiment the results tell us that it is the color that absorbs the least energy from the lamp. The dog will be comfortable during the summer living inside his kennel.
es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV1YEO6J	black :: The black color maximizes the internal temperature and could be useful in the winter.
es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV4WX6OJ	white :: The white color is the color that will bring the best benefits to the house because it is the one that absorbs less heat as it is the lightest color, dark colors absorb light and that directly affects the temperature, while light colors, in this case white, reflect light and absorb less heat.
es_3AQF3RZ55AV78Z2BCNFT285HBTY6FK	"light gray :: There is a classic home experiment that consists of putting a candle in a dish with a little water and covering it with a glass. The candle consumes oxygen until it goes out, and the water goes into the glass, since the pressure there has decreased a lot. It always comes out, it comes out very well and it is very grateful... what is not so clear is what really happens, and what is the reason for this pressure variation. Javier Fernรกndez Panadero, a few days ago published about it here in Naukas (see) making it clear that the ""classical"" explanation is not the good one."
es_3ATTHHXXWC1415OXEIU45IVTPQRXI1	white :: The temperature changes depending on the color, if black makes the temperature go up then white makes it go down.
es_3AUQQEL7U761QL2MAD4GBTYCMX3V0P	white :: The results say that white causes the lowest temperature. Therefore, white should be used.
es_3B1NLC6UG19LW5GB23KKQTWA316GPP	black :: black because it will be warmer for the dog
es_3B1NLC6UG19LW5GB23KKQTWA40TPGK	white :: The color white can make the house feel cool when it is very hot outside and the dog will not get too hot.
es_3B837J3LDQ99YN5HAVIQK2FSTOZSRD	dark gray :: The temperature inside the canister will increase.
es_3BC8WZX3V59XX854V6ILUSAW8KBRRG	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because it does not absorb as much heat and light as the other colors used in the experiment. The kennel would not be as warm inside if the kennel is painted white. In the experiment, the white top only had an average of 42 degrees C while the others had a higher average than the white top.
es_3BDCF01OGZ7VRBMD4HDJGCUU4CFLYT	white :: the temperature increases regardless of the color, but the white color increases less degrees of temperature. That would be more comfortable for the dog in the kennel in hot weather.
es_3BQU611VFRXLP8DW78IDCMA806999Q	white :: When painted white, the sun's rays are reflected more strongly, so the amount of heat absorbed is less, as shown in the table above, so it is better to paint white to reduce the temperature inside the doghouse.
es_3BQU611VFRXLP8DW78IDCMA8Y8K993	light gray :: if it is summer, the temperature will not be so high inside the doghouse. If it is winter, it will allow it to warm up a little more than if it had a white kennel. I consider light gray to be neutral
es_3BWI6RSP7IMY6LGK0M0FQ4KDS7ZE7B	white :: I would choose white as it absorbs less energy, which will help to keep the temperatures inside the kennel cooler for the dog.
es_3BXQMRHWK1BYGKKTUSH9D436785UMA	white :: White would be the most suitable color because it is the one that keeps the temperature cooler, so the environment does not become too hot.
es_3C5W7UE9CH3QXOEOZXSWXB2A1FKMX6	white :: White paint colors lower the house temperature by ten to twelve degrees, so it is better to have white or light gray paint.
es_3CCZ6YKWR9W2OLBK4I5W0656BM095U	white :: The results of the experiment prove that white color retains less energy. Therefore the white color would be more suitable for the house.
es_3CFJTT4SXV3AMQI6W5Q6BJI5JKK7IU	white :: White would be the best color to ensure that the inside of the house does not get too hot. The average temperature of the white color was the lowest in the experiment (42C) and the darker the color, the higher the temperature.
es_3CFVK00FWNYT8RC7YYIRXLA144G6LB	light gray :: Light gray is a neutral color and therefore the temperature would be at an average level.
es_3CFVK00FWNYT8RC7YYIRXLA146UL68	white :: White is the best color because it maintains the lowest temperature inside the doghouse.  If the kennel is temporarily outside in the sun, then the dog will be less likely to suffocate, as the average temperature with white inside the kennel is 42 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest of all the colors. However, if it is the autumn or winter season outside, then it will be better to choose black, as it will warm the doghouse better under the sun's rays outside.
es_3CN4LGXD5Z1ZT3FSYPE2UVSJKLX4YO	white :: The white color does not absorb heat and will not raise the temperature of the kennel. In summer the dog will be able to stay inside the kennel without being hot.
es_3CPLWGV3MQC6EAHQ8I1IUN5S0XIN9U	dark gray :: the heat that is concentrated inside the canister causes the color that begins to spread inside the canister to decrease in intensity from black to a fainter color.
es_3D8YOU6S9GXWRHZ17CASO86KHXHU65	white :: The white color would be the color that would make the temperature lower so it shows the average and so the dog would be in a better situation.
es_3DBQWDE4Y8BNDNFE5SO1I70QG6JN5Z	light gray :: I think it would give a lighter shade in the booths.
es_3DBQWDE4Y8BNDNFE5SO1I70QLQW5N3	blanco :: Describe Como see color podiatry affect Al interior DE la cassette. USA sol resultants Del experiments para apiary too description.
es_3DI28L7YXCRKVZ1IB6J6PUT0RKTE18	black :: Because it is the color that absorbs the most temperature, the thermometer indicates that the temperature inside the house is higher than the other exposed colors.
es_3DL65MZB8FS4I2BGR38Q6QCRSS8CE3	light gray :: The lighter the color, the lower the temperature inside the house. I chose light gray, but I could also have chosen dark gray, as any of these colors would be useful for both cold and warm climates. White in a cold climate would make the house colder but in a warm climate it would make the temperature inside more pleasant, and on the contrary with black the house in a warm climate would be very hot, but in a cold climate it could bring some warmth.
es_3DPNQGW4LNSXAJ5MS6JAB48QJFG466	black :: It could increase the temperature inside the house because dark colors tend to accentuate the heat.
es_3DR23U6WE7RL4JDRDP3GV0CVNAUET9	white :: The light colors unlike the dark ones have greater difficulty to absorb the light waves, so they tend to have greater difficulty to retain this energy in the form of heat, so the ideal color for the dog's house is white, because this is the lightest and most convenient for the above mentioned.
es_3DUZQ9U6SO11RUMYJFN0LZ4VDRCVS2	white :: The white color will make the temperature of the doghouse not to increase as much as in the case of using a darker color paint. White would be ideal to prevent the dog from overheating and to be comfortable inside the kennel.
es_3DUZQ9U6SO11RUMYJFN0LZ4VDUNSVG	white :: The white color would be the most suitable to paint the house, since it is the color that helps to keep the temperature inside the house from getting too hot. S
es_3DY4FPOOA31PQFML4QNVVPZZRRARVV	black :: In all tests the black color rose more in temperature compared to the other colors.
es_3DYGAII7PNLC9UAP5ZPWK70C9OZQPE	white :: According to the experiment, white would be the most suitable color for the house, since it would maintain a good temperature.
es_3DYGAII7PNLC9UAP5ZPWK70CA03PQ6	light gray :: If we do not know the climatic conditions, we do not know if we want to bring a higher or lower temperature to the kennel. We should have a white doghouse in summer and a black doghouse in winter. Assuming we could only build one and in a cold climate in winter and warm in summer. My choice would be medium gray, although here I have selected light gray for lack of another option. The light gray would warm the shed a bit, but not too much.
es_3DYGAII7PNLC9UAP5ZPWK70CG6UQPG	light gray :: According to this table, the four different tables black, dark gray, light gray white My choice is light griss because it is perfect for house painting.
es_3E13VNJ1NP8WB4347P9XA9RSFQ9I1G	white :: Using a white lid would be better than the other three colors because white raises the temperature only to an average of 42 degrees Celsius.  The other colors increase the air temperature inside the canister higher and would be dangerous to your dog.
es_3E13VNJ1NP8WB4347P9XA9RSIU31I4	White :: The lamp produces infrared heat which is similar to the heat of the sun's rays. Light colored surfaces reflect infrared heat compared to dark surfaces that absorb it. A dark crate would get very hot during the day, so a light colored crate would be much more comfortable because the temperature would be more constant.
es_3E13VNJ1NP8WB4347P9XA9RSJKTI1S	white :: This color for the doghouse paint generates the lowest possible internal heating of the doghouse against an external heat source (practical example: sun).
es_3E1QT0TDFRMEM4NP6AICPJE0TWG8IR	white :: Being the lightest color and after seeing the results of the experiment, it is easy to conclude that it is the right color for the house, as it will keep the air inside cooler than the other options.
es_3E1QT0TDFRMEM4NP6AICPJE0YUF8IR	blanco :: Blanco
es_3E337GFOLBLLTK4YMO7SM4RF4Z8GNN	white :: Color selected: whiteIt can be concluded based on the results of the experiment that the colors can be affected by temperature: \Depending on the temperature you want the pet to have, you should choose the color. The color white was selected because it showed the lowest temperature and can give comfort to the dog in hot weather. Depending on the temperature you want on the scale from cooler to warmer, the following options are presented: option 1: white option 2: light gray option 3: dark gray option 4: black
es_3E337GFOLBLLTK4YMO7SM4RFBWPNGC	white :: as that color the results of the experiment 43 white light gray 44 45
es_3E4GGUZ1TA4U6KBOQWUNS8GA03BK2G	White :: The doghouse will be cooler indoors when the sun is bright and the temperature is hot outside. The white heat paint will reflect the sun's energy. Well done Brandi and Jerry!
es_3E4GGUZ1TA4U6KBOQWUNS8GA1LBK2H	light gray :: Because it is an intermediate color, both in summer and winter it would give better results retaining heat on cold days and maintaining an acceptable temperature on hotter days.
es_3E4GGUZ1TA4U6KBOQWUNS8GA28OK25	white :: The white color is the one that repels more energy and therefore absorbs less heat. If we place a white roof, the heat will be transmitted to a lesser extent to the interior of the house and will remain at a lower temperature.
es_3E7TUJ2EGEZXSYQDJONFYITYMS1D9L	white :: The white color is the recommended color because it absorbs less temperature and the house is kept with lower temperature than another color.
es_3EG49X351WPO8LTWCHLF8F5ODRWX6O	"white :: A hypothesis is not necessarily correct. Rather, it is a ""best guess"" and scientists must test it to see if it is indeed correct. Scientists test hypotheses by making predictions: if the hypothesis text YYY is correct, then text YYY should be true. They then perform experiments or observations to see if the predictions are correct. If they are, the hypothesis is supported. If not, it is time to make new hypotheses."
es_3EJJQNKU9TIK8ER1Z16RGO8QRWBRHT	white :: color could affect the inside of the house
es_3F0BG9B9MR0WCQXB0NC9X7CT9WEY79	White :: White is the color that absorbs less energy due to its composition, since it is formed by all the colors. For Brandi and Jerry's doghouse the ideal color is the bench because it had lower temperature and the variation between test was 1-2 degrees so with that result we can object that the white has lower temperature and the variation of the average temperature is minimal.
es_3F6KKYWMNDEIH0U7KY6KGJOITMYNDM	white :: The white color would help the dog inside the kennel to stay in a temperature controlled place and closer to the temperature outside the kennel.
es_3FE7TXL1LK0GHN9J31EKOUSJY8Z2QJ	white :: According to the results of the experiment, the best color for the doghouse is white. it absorbs the least temperature, so it would be the ideal color for Brandi and Jerry's dog.
es_3FFJ6VRIL31W4FIMB65XW48IAXV0IL	light gray :: The light gray color would help to raise the temperature a little bit and the puppy would not feel so cold. Using a darker color would be detrimental because the dog would feel too hot and would want to be out of the house.
es_3FQ5JJ512N1QV60HCFS7KWJ8ATLNKI	white :: The air temperature with the white color was the lowest with 42 C. The kennel has to be white so that the dog does not suffer from high temperatures. The darker the paint, the worse it would be for the dog.
es_3FQ5JJ512N1QV60HCFS7KWJ8AVMNKN	white :: I would choose the white color because the temperature increases at a slower rate than the dark colors. This is important considering that the dog also needs lower temperatures with all the hair they have. Based on the experiment, white proves to have a lower temperature.
es_3FTF2T8WLTVW14Q40JS5Q6IJSETW9A	white :: white is more awakening than the others.
es_3FTF2T8WLTVW14Q40JS5Q6IJUDA9W4	white :: As white is the color that absorbs the least energy, the inside of the house will not heat up as much as using other colors.
es_3FTF2T8WLTVW14Q40JS5Q6IJXRLW9X	white :: The white color, by reflecting the sun's rays, will cause the temperature of the canister to be lower than with any other color paint. The results of the experiment support this as they indicate that the temperatures inside the glass jar are lower when using the white lid.
es_3FTYUGLFSWYERBO1GYAYM2OW01L5DZ	black :: According to the results of the experiment, a black house will be warmer than a white house because darker colors absorb more energy and will increase the temperature inside the house.
es_3G0WWMR1UXXC69YCPKC4GIVHB7RQN9	light gray :: The light gray color would be the best choice, according to the results table it is in the middle of the extremes which would make the external temperature variations due to seasonal changes not so extreme.
es_3GDTJDAPVWO0INDGRPG4HCLHALQM87	grey claro :: Blanco
es_3GDTJDAPVWO0INDGRPG4HCLHI4R8M4	dark gray :: GEIS DARK GEIS
es_3H0W84IWBMF8O40Z90YLVLBDRWXREF	dark gray :: An important data for this experiment is the climate of the area where the hut is installed, I think I could choose the dark gray because the temperature is more stable and the black color for example if in summer it is very hot would be too uncomfortable to rest.
es_3H7XDTSHKE4BGEDCEPYFIN461XDGWR	white :: The color does have an effect on the temperature that the house will have inside. From the data given, the color that consumes less energy is white compared to black.
es_3H7Z272LX9K1IXUCDUH03L1I31ILPW	light gray :: I consider that it is an intermediate point since there are other factors that are not being taken into account such as the location of the hut (outdoor or not), if it is usually a humid or hot climate, etc...
es_3H7Z272LX9K1IXUCDUH03L1IZ8IPLA	white :: White is the color that would raise the temperature inside the kennel the least on hot days (18 ยฐC above the initial temperature, compared to almost 30 ยฐC when black is used). In winter any other of the colors used in the experiment would contribute to temper the temperature inside the kennel, but given the characteristics of the dogs and their coat, it is more convenient to prioritize that in summer the temperature does not rise too much.
es_3HFNH7HEMJR6WHHQ2GZ9QYMKCO7QGR	black :: the black color is the best color to affect the inside of the kennel because the black color is the one that attracts the heat of the air better. That is why the dog could be better off. The data proves it because the black kennel manages to have a temperature of 54 degrees, more or less.
es_3HHRAGRYXAIOWVH29X1V9C5XSIG9OC	white :: According to the results, white is the color that absorbs the least heat from the sun's rays, so the temperature inside the doghouse will not be as high as if it were painted with other colors.
es_3HMIGG0U4NJ0C42UAS4FB78OKHJ8Y7	white :: If what you want is a house with a lower temperature (especially for summer), the color should be white, because it does not absorb heat as darker colors would.
es_3HMVI3QICL5I14I9B7V0WXLGCN51Y2	dark gray :: Dark gray is the medium color that would react best as a real good choice to make the house, the temperature would be in good condition, the house will look good and will represent a really wonderful home to live in.
es_3HOSI13XH119VO3UV4SHKECOH91DDJ	white :: ACCORDING TO THIS TABLE BRANDI AND JERRY CHOOSE THE FOUR COLOR CHOICE, ONE IS BLACK, DARK GREY, LIGHT GREY, BALNCO. I THINK THE PERFECT WHITE COLOR BECUASE TEST 1 AND TEST 2 IS MINGLE 42 AND 43 AND TEST 3 AND A HALF IS 41 AND 42 SO ANY COMBINATION IS VERY GOOD AND WHITE IS PERFECT FOR THE DOG.
es_3HPZF4IVNO62O7S7R4KKDT47B3PCYT	black :: According to the results of the experiment, black is the color that would increase the house temperature the most. This is because black absorbs light instead of reflecting it, so it receives more energy from it. This color would be ideal for use in houses intended for cold areas.
es_3HPZF4IVNO62O7S7R4KKDT47C7AYC9	light gray :: temperature in dark gray did not change at all
es_3HRMW88U183I0Y8DWL3POXFZUY30MC	white :: White is the color with the lowest temperature in all tests. For a doghouse it would be the best color to keep the dog from getting hot.
es_3HVVDCPGTG5JAOUIDQFA234BXTCYTR	black :: The black color will give a warmer home for the dog.
es_3HYA4D452TWJQYJAPL3QCVO5R3T2FM	light gray :: Light gray
es_3HYA4D452TWJQYJAPL3QCVO5R4EF2M	white :: The best color is white because it keeps the air inside the house cooler. It is noticeable from the results of the experiment that the white lid kept the canister temperature lower than the other lids.
es_3I2PTA7R3V7BY3D9S7KOOQEDFBUKQ2	light gray :: It could impact the interior by making it look more vibrant, modern and attractive.
es_3I33IC7ZWHFOU722E5HYYUDEZK3A23	white :: THE INSIDE OF THE BOOTH WILL BE COOLER. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE RESULTS, THE AIR TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE GLASS JAR WITH THE WHITE LID WAS 42, 43, 41 AND 42. IN ALL FOUR TESTS THAT WAS THE LOWEST RESULT. THAT IS GOOD. AND IT MEANS THAT THE WHITE COLOR IS THE COOLEST COLOR.
es_3I3WADAZ9SH5V8FQ67OEXW0V8YN5OX	white :: because the white pitura heats up less and the temperature is lower
es_3IGI0VL649X9LXLWA7K0RD0HUZ1NOA	black :: Light is nothing more than electromagnetic radiation and as such, it carries energy. Light colors, such as white, reflect radiation the most, and therefore absorb very little or radiate the energy they absorb very quickly. Dark colors, such as black or dark gray, absorb the most radiation. They are able to absorb a lot of energy of this type, and then slowly radiate it away. Thus, if we use dark colors for our dog's kennel, they will absorb solar radiation during the day, and provide our dog with warmth for a longer period of time during the night. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature inside the kennel will be when the light is turned off, as shown in the results of the table, and the same will happen when the solar radiation is gone at nightfall. The temperature will be higher and the heat will be maintained inside the house for a longer period of time.
es_3IHR8NYAM9E5KPNR72IJH4Z7FB9P4J	black :: The color black will affect the house making the light cooler.
es_3II4UPYCOLK3KX7Z0QY1KDJNWT8QDP	light gray :: The difference in temperature between white and light gray is very little and the dog would enjoy the gray color more since they do not see in black and white.
es_3IJXV6UZ1ZWK492L5JOCG095LP1IRE	white :: The white color guarantees a lower temperature inside the doghouse, according to the results of the experiments carried out. The gray colors would cause a slight increase and the black color would cause the highest temperature.
es_3IOEN3P9S9WGIK835O08D61N9XV16L	black :: Because the darker the color, the more the energy absorption increases and, therefore, the result is black.
es_3IQ1VMJRYVXZURN1ZEWD8HLS1139A2	white :: from the results, the white color is the one of which the temperature does not go up as much as the other color caps.
es_3IRIK4HM3CX05NI1LLPSU2KEFFEC6M	white :: The white is the one with the lowest temperature in one of the studies compared to the others in the experiments.
es_3IXQG4FA2VB4D1ST5SW93S5YIBZ9BR	white :: This is the most indicated color, since it will not heat the dog too much, since the white color does not raise the temperature as much as the black or darker color. Of course, the external temperature should also be taken into account. In very cold places the most indicated is to use the black color, and in hot places it is the white. Greetings.
es_3J88R45B2IBWIRB1RDKOEFW56MRPX5	black :: if you make a house with a black cover, the house will be warmer, because the roof absorbs more heat.
es_3J88R45B2IBWIRB1RDKOEFW57N7PXO	white :: According to the experiment, white is the color that has the least heat spread. Another color would be too hot for the dog
es_3JBT3HLQFAFLNMBGSV89B0CGEKSZPB	dark gray :: This color resulted in 48 every time, so the temperature of the house can be controlled taking into account that it does not vary from one time to another.
es_3JJVG1YBEDALCEQH22JSRC0WWFPB5B	white :: The darker the color, the more energy it absorbs and the more heat it generates. So white would be the best choice.
es_3JPSL1DZ5UCKJTRV0OFIQIGC6JTNAA	white :: the lighter the color of the house, the less the air temperature inside the house will increase, because light colors absorb less energy.
es_3JV9LGBJWVR3B54AN3751TRKXB9OGD	white :: the white color keeps the temperature of the dog house low and the dogs with their body heat need a cool place because the dog house is closed, the white color keeps the temperature low and the dog will not be so hot.
es_3JWH6J9I9UQP23WN62FELT0IP4SBNE	white :: Using white will result in a lower temperature compared to other colors and will be more comfortable for the dog.
es_3K4J6M3CXG6E91A9DK2N0Y7F47OAG5	white :: Looking at the results obtained in the experiment, you could assume that the facts demonstrated in the experiment also apply to the doghouse. Considering this, if the doghouse is painted with a dark color, the temperature inside the doghouse will rise as in the experiment, while using a lighter paint, such as white, would reduce the temperature of the air inside the doghouse.
es_3KGTPGBS6ZY89GG0KAYPYVP81W8U2P	white :: White, because it is the color that attracts the least heat, since the darker the color, the more heat it absorbs.
es_3KJYX6QCMBO8SR38WLEMTYD8HF1VJ2	white :: the white color, being a light color, does not absorb so much energy. According to the data table, the white color has the lowest temperatures being the most favorable.
es_3KMS4QQVK43E7EN0ER9UCRAZ92TFKY	black :: The lid is black, so the color will be higher. The 'Data' section lists the relationship between temperature and color.
es_3KRVW3HTZPYI17SP5NM9Y3LIM4CSM6	white :: Since white is the lightest color, it will absorb less energy and there will be less heat in the house.
es_3KWTYT0872GXPNCTTF8M5FW1FHM5LY	dark gray :: dark gray
es_3L0KT67Y8GTIVOH3OQAKSY8PVBKSYK	white :: The white color is the one that best insulates the concentration of heat which is optimal for warm days and / or nights, in case of winter you can opt for an option other than the paint to be used as insulation and protection against the cold.
es_3L0KT67Y8GTIVOH3OQAKSY8PZV2YSG	white :: Because the white color provides energy and also gives an aesthetic form of the house.
es_3L2IS5HSFCV4Y25T6TW9QJS6DT8NUN	white :: Choosing the white color causes the temperature to be stable.
es_3LEIZ60CDLC0VZV9B6CCPAC19DIZ9I	white :: According to the data from Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the white lid increased the temperature inside the kennel the least. So a white roof (and walls) for a doghouse would be the most suitable for the comfort of the pet. However, the approach does not say under what conditions the kennel will be used. Perhaps in an area with low temperatures (Alaska for example), a kennel with a dark roof could help to maintain a more suitable temperature for the pet.
es_3LJ7UR74RJQ5H4BERN5RDFUCFN4N4Z	black :: black would be better
es_3LO69W1SU5QV5K1DABRD9CNQ3DELGI	white :: The result of the experiment shows that the darker the color of the surface, the warmer the interior is, while the object receives light. I choose to paint the kennel white so that the inside does not get too hot for my dog.
es_3LRKMWOKB7UPVFAAQ\nFN4N5I92ZI	white :: White repels sunlight and therefore heat.
es_3LRKMWOKB7UPVFAAQ\nFN4N7SB2Z6	black :: The tests carried out in the experiment confirm Brandi and Jerri's hypothesis: the temperature of the container was higher the darker the color of the lid placed next to the heat source. Thus, the black color, being the darkest, absorbs more energy and is the best suited to conserve the heat received by the doghouse, for example, by solar radiation.
es_3LRLIPTPESMJBN6S3BN2YQZ8BVQKAH	White :: White color is the best color because it allows heat to be reflected from the source and only a small amount of heat is transmitted inside. Based on the experiment results show that white color has the lowest temperature inside the jar and makes the dog comfortable compared to other colors.
es_3LUY3GC631D23C5A90GQKGJH4R47PG	dark gray :: Dark gray paint keeps the temperature constant.
es_3LWJHTCVCEZ0IHLVRWTR8DM8FWYFQM	dark gray :: Temperature is not too hot or cold with dark gray color
es_3M68NM076JK4BP7K3IFNJXJ0AVAR6P	white :: White will give less heat to the house as it is the color that absorbs less heat energy.
es_3M68NM076JK4BP7K3IFNJXJ0AVM6RG	white :: WHITE COLOR REFLACTS LIGHT THEREFORE IT HEATS LESS. WHILE THE DARKER THE COLOR, THE MORE LIGHT IT ATTRACTS AND THE MORE HEAT IT CONCENTRATES.
es_3M81GAB8A2WA509FMU7VPNVNUKCQBN	white :: The white color would be more reflective and therefore block some of the sunlight during the day, which would allow the temperature to be lower inside the building.
es_3MHW492WW2QYTZ9TZIRE9Q5PL47MVY	white :: The lighter the color, the lower the temperature and the more comfortable the dog will be.
es_3MMN5BL1W1HEHQ7AF8L8QVD615V3MC	white :: By choosing white color the doghouse should not be so hot.
es_3MMN5BL1W1HEHQ7AF8L8QVD6USO3M8	light gray :: Light gray is the best color for the house because the temperature is not too low or too high and can help it adapt to different outdoor temperatures.
es_3MMN5BL1W1HEHQ7AF8L8QVD6WO1M3Y	dark gray :: No way. since it does not interfere with the temperature inside the doghouse.
es_3MTMREQS4XVA6N09SP65M1T3Z4CWA7	black :: Black gets warmer according to the results.
es_3MX2NQ3YCB7SPHTI7YBAG9ROF0TX5M	white :: I would choose white, so that the dog does not get hot, white is the one that least increases the temperature, it can even insulate it, so it would be a good choice to choose the color mentioned above.
es_3N1FSUEFL7DWVSK12TROHAIIZA64DI	white :: According to the results of the experiment, the temperature inside the canister remained lower when the white lid was used. Therefore, they have shown that dark colors do indeed retain more heat and light colors retain less heat. Using white for the doghouse will keep the internal temperature cooler than using a dark color.
es_3N8OEVH1FT3R3IL8BMKD620MRHUOO1	white :: soft
es_3NG53N1RLXW63QATJ58WYGFCGJH8PS	black :: The black color has the highest temperature in the experiment results.
es_3NG53N1RLXW63QATJ58WYGFCGMM8P3	white :: Dark colors absorb more light and will be warmer for the dog.
es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGCYKMDU0	white :: The kennel will stay cooler because white is the color that raises the temperature inside the glass container the least. If they use the white color, the dog house will be much cooler when they turn on the lamp (if they are going to have a lamp inside the house) or simply with sunlight. As shown in the results the two colors with the smallest temperature variation are light gray and white. The difference between white and light gray is only a few degrees Celsius, but for efficiency and maximum use of the low temperature, it would be best to use white. \But it would also be ideal to use the black color in case the dog is located in a very cold environment where temperatures usually drop at night or even during the day, the black color would help him to keep the heat of a light bulb inside the house.
es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGCZ25UD1	black :: 1/ put on the black glass jar with the black glass jar with the filter attached 2/ make sure the initial temperature inside the jar is 24ยฐC 3/ put the scentimeter lamp away from the lid and turn it on 4/ after 10 minutes, measure the temperature of the air inside the glass jar and put it on with test
es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGCZ27UD3	white :: The lighter the color of the house, the lower the temperature difference reached inside the house.
es_3NPI0JQDAQIP1A2HM3JRPCBZTRGPT1	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color, as it does not make the house too hot or too cold. Anyway, this experiment is indicative of what might result in a hutch, as it is not going to be 10 minutes under a lamp. Still, an in-between color would be most suitable in my opinion.
es_3NPI0JQDAQIP1A2HM3JRPCBZX90PTP	white :: White paint should be used to keep a lower temperature and maintain a cool environment inside the doghouse, since according to the experiment the white color makes the interior less warm than if dark colors were used.
es_3NQL1CS15TLYNGY7ILFP3LSW208VY0	black :: The black top results in warmer temperature during all experiments. The black color obscures more heat.
es_3NVC2EB65SCEB7WOYB9JKQ0D3XC3YY	white :: The best color is white which retains less heat. In this way, the dog of the two children will not die of heat.
es_3O7L7BFSHG2VV5XGJD4CHTAM70SEIF	light gray :: grise claro
es_3OE22WJIGK1P1ZILMLOQUDNBM53UQV	light gray :: The initial temperature was 24 c in all tests.
es_3OF2M9AATI1KCVE0F331FJQHMHBZKF	white :: The house would be cooler with white.
es_3OF2M9AATI1KCVE0F331FJQHR6QKZY	white :: The white color absorbs the least energy, and therefore, the air temperature inside the house will be the lowest. The test results prove the hypothesis.
es_3OHYZ19UGEI21ER713FV57GHWVJOAF	white :: Painting the house white will keep it cooler as light colors retain less heat.
es_3OLF68YTNBE8V1EE20W5ID73AQ8FAY	black :: because that color had more punctuation.
es_3OLQQLKKNU2RQGHM1VPCTUPMNS3EJ6	light gray :: White reflects radiant energy while dark colors such as gray or black absorb it. The warmer the roof is the warmer it will be inside the house. Therefore I chose the light gray color so that the inside of the house is neither too cold nor too hot.
es_3OS4RQUCRBSDEBJ68EW1DOR9Q3VBFF	white :: Much less heat
es_3OSWBBLG1GANTU8BM4TTELFGTX0XD0	white :: Using the results of the experiment, I determined that white would be the best option. Compared to the other colors, white produces the least amount of heat absorption.
es_3OVR4I9USRWQK1O67FX8H9PHMC44QA	white :: I choose white because the data from all three tests show that the house would be a cooler temperature than my family prefers. We live in Texas, where most days are warm.
es_3OWEPKL08BP20RTXTL3YGREM4BB7NQ	white :: The white color would be the ideal, because the lighter it is, the cooler it will be inside the dog's house, because light colors absorb less energy, that is to say, it would maintain a not so hot environment.
es_3OWEPKL08BP20RTXTL3YGREM4LIN7X	white :: based on the table I find that the white color will give a lower room temperature, this way brandi and jerry's dog will be more comfortable and cooler, the other option could be light gray because the difference between temperatures is not very big, black is definitely not an option because the temperature increase is too high.
es_3OXV7EAXLG3CSNMISSER1ZGK4IQ36V	white :: When they paint the kennel for their dog, they care about the effects of the color on the temperature inside.  A dog will suffer a lot (and possibly die) in an environment that is too hot, and you need a kennel that does not absorb so much heat.  From the experiment, we can see that the darker lids retain more heat (from all the tests), and the white lid retains less heat.  Therefore, we can see that white is the best color if we are looking for a paint that will be cooler after a long time in the sun.  And a less hot temperature will be better for the dog.
es_3P59JYT76NXT931BK58FTZ36NL62TM	white :: white would be good, because if the room temperature is 24 degrees it means that it is already a comfortable temperature and there is no need to heat more, so the white would maintain a good temperature for the dog.
es_3PDJHANYK7TRMVTH7D3T5THUNM96H4	white :: The black color absorbs a lot of heat, not allowing light and heat to escape, that is why the temperature inside the house would increase in the case of black color. That is why I choose the white color to give more freshness to the house.
es_3PDJHANYK7TRMVTH7D3T5THUSW1H6W	white :: the white color reflect the light and then the temperature is lower.
es_3PEIJLRY6V6M20823ZYJ6941298WX4	black :: I BELIEVE THAT BLACK WOULD HOLD TEMPERATURE FOR A LONGER TIME
es_3PEIJLRY6V6M20823ZYJ69412R5WX1	white :: According to the experiment, white is the color that least increases the temperature of the place, in this case, the kennel. The dog will feel more comfortable in a cooler environment, although the kennel would need additional ventilation.
es_3PEIJLRY6V6M20823ZYJ6941ZPWXWM	white :: The experiment showed that the color white makes the air inside less warm, so you could think that putting the roof white can help to make the doghouse cooler for the dog.
es_3PIWWX1FJLJZ1W3EFW03QA2ERNMJJS	white :: It will keep it as fresh as possible.
es_3PJ71Z61R6F303A13V3KXGSPW0Q19K	white :: The lamp can only reach a certain temperature.
es_3PJ71Z61R6F303A13V3KXGSPZAJ190	white :: With this color, the kennel would absorb less energy, based on the results of the exercise, so the air temperature inside the kennel would be the lowest possible, making it more comfortable for the dog.
es_3PWWM24LHUBABJ9NH7XK237J58X82B	white :: for a better thermal comfort of your dog you should use the white cover.
es_3PZDLQMM0VYCNMZ0YJDP4P32U3R2CR	white :: It will be the color that keeps the house cooler.
es_3Q5C1WP23OEKZG8P05Q3L0NNA4J155	white :: The white color absorbs the least amount of energy, therefore, the temperature inside the house would be lower compared to a darker color. This same reasoning is supported by the experiment with the different colored lids.
es_3QEMNNSB2ZCTEF2K4RPVKM2SR19D73	light gray :: The darker the color of the exterior, the more energy it absorbs, with white being the color that absorbs the least energy and black the most. Therefore in summer a black color would make the interior temperature rise a lot, while a white one would make the interior temperature more pleasant. In winter it would be the other way around, a dark color would be more interesting, so perhaps an intermediate color would be ideal.
es_3QIYRE09Y5UOP5EV45MPFHN91OS1N2	white :: According to the data, dark colors absorb more energy. Therefore a lighter color would be the right one, since it has the lowest temperature.
es_3QJOXOW4XL4HRON74S249MH3M8HEMW	white :: If the climate where the dog will live is warm, the best color is white to keep the interior cooler.
es_3QJOXOW4XL4HRON74S249MH3M9UEMB	white :: White is the color with the lowest average air temperature inside the glass canister. White is the color that absorbs the least energy so it would affect the inside of the house the least.
es_3QUO65DNQW1MGN5578WM58SB3YYUOK	white :: By painting the house white, Brandi and Jerry ensure that the heat inside the house is less than if they painted it another color. This is because their hypothesis was found to be correct after experiments with other colors.
es_3QXNC7EIPK83TEPJ7CZKJB9FRLR90M	white :: The color white is chosen so that the kennel does not heat up so much inside and the dog is more comfortable, as can be seen in the data of the experimental table, by choosing a lighter color, the interior will heat up less. It is also known that black or opaque colors (such as light gray or dark girs) tend to absorb more radiation.
es_3QY7M81QH9Z1SL8UW8BIOZXID5P7KL	light gray :: in the daytime the dog will be able to get up well and see the light. Then at night the doggy will have peace to sleep.
es_3QY7M81QH9Z1SL8UW8BIOZXIDGNK7I	white :: If the temperature of the house is equal to that of the experiment, I choose white because 53, 48 and 45 degrees is too much for any animal.
es_3R08VXYT7E8SNL2BLMULCARDYL0W7O	white :: Painting the house white would help keep it from becoming hot inside on a sunny day, as white will reflect solar energy more than a darker color. In the test conducted with the different colored lids, it shows that of the four colors, white caused the temperature inside the jar to rise the least.
es_3R0T90IZ1UP22G77XYYE6TX3CZDGC3	white :: White because the house is cooler in summer and warmer in winter.
es_3R3YRB5GRHGXEJB4XPR44D86DF1UAN	white :: The white color would be better for the kennel paint, because it absorbs less energy from the sun, and that is why the dog has a kennel that is not too hot. The experiment clearly shows that dark colors absorb more energy and more heat.
es_3R3YRB5GRHGXEJB4XPR44D86H7GUAQ	white :: The white color would prevent the building from getting too hot in direct sunlight, especially in summer.
es_3R6BYFZZP9PKREM7DAOJ2LI16Z8XFI	white :: It all depends on the desired temperature, if you live in a warm place it is better to use white to keep the doghouse cooler. If you live in a cold place, black would be ideal to keep the kennel warmer.
es_3R6BYFZZP9PKREM7DAOJ2LI1BUQXFV	white :: The white color would be the most ideal because that way when the sun hits the kennel it won't get too hot inside when the dogs are in there.
es_3RANCT1ZVHU2XTGW33R0ZOSCVWEUB8	white :: Regardless of their color, most solid surfaces that are subjected to a source of radiant heat absorb heat and transmit it to their surroundings, raising their temperature. But depending on their color, those surfaces will absorb a different degree of heat. The experiment showed that surfaces with darker colors absorb more heat in 10 minutes than surfaces with lighter colors. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry choose a lighter color for the paint in their dog's house, more solar radiation will be reflected from the roof and walls, which will heat up less and transmit less heat to the inside of the dog's house. This is important because sunlight falls on the house, not just for 10 minutes, but for many hours a day, sometimes up to 15 hours. But there is a difference: The experiment was done with an airtight heat receiver (closed at the top with the lid and at the sides and bottom with glass). On the other hand, the dog house has the hole where the dog goes in and out, which allows air to come in and out, making the inside of the house cooler.  A small window can be made in the wall opposite the entrance of the dog house, so that the air effectively flows through the house and cools it further.
es_3RJSC4XJ127KSRN74MM37V4DA7F05Y	white :: The white color of the kennel will make the inside of the kennel not so hot, so the dog will not be too hot in the summer.
es_3RKNTXVS3OBYXLHPIJ0MR9ACGP44AD	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the lighter white color for the booth for their dog because then the dog will not get too hot.  The temperatures for white were less than light gray, dark gray or black.  So it would probably be a good ceiling color.
es_3RRCEFRB7OP3GVMHOX0IMKUI0IA4BH	white :: I chose the white color because the darker the color of the cover, the more the air temperature will increase and this would be inconvenient for your dog. Undoubtedly the white color is the best option thinking about the dog, since the temperature increases less.
es_3RRCEFRB7OP3GVMHOX0IMKUIWKVB49	white :: If a dark color is used for the kennel, the air inside the kennel could heat up too much and suffocate the dog, therefore, the color chosen is white so that when the sunlight hits it, it heats up as little as possible without reaching a dangerous temperature, according to the table the white color could heat up to 43ยบ, while the black color for example 54ยบ....
es_3RSDURM96CZHL5CLNVQF3H4AVIPYE0	dark gray :: I think this color is perfect since black is very warm and white is not the right color for an animal since it will get dirty very quickly.
es_3RU7GD8VPQ6OMAP2X3E1F7FDR2ZSP0	white :: The color should be white, as it does not absorb as much radiation and thus prevents the temperature from increasing and suffocating the animal during daylight hours due to sunlight.
es_3RU7GD8VPQ6OMAP2X3E1F7FDRD6PSQ	white :: For the cold I can use blankets, but the worst problem would be the heat in summer, so if I make it white it will be less hot.
es_3RU7GD8VPQ6OMAP2X3E1F7FDSP4SPG	white :: We will choose white for the doghouse to keep it cooler in the sunlight. After testing it is observed that the white cover absorbs less heat than any other color.
es_3RU7GD8VPQ6OMAP2X3E1F7FDWLJPSO	white :: A house painted white heats up less quickly than any other color.
es_3RWE2M8QWJNOIGTD8MIP1C4ZXYI0NZ	black :: The black color affects the temperature inside the house because the black color can absorb more heat from the sun than the other colors.
es_3RWE2M8QWJNOIGTD8MIP1C4ZZXKN0O	white :: White is better because it seems that the other colors do absorb more energy. The inside of the doghouse would get warmer with the other colored paints, in the same way that the glass jar with the other colored lids got warmer.
es_3RXCAC0YIT20QDHUGMI9471KEH68GD	white :: cooler and colder
es_3RXCAC0YIT20QDHUGMI9471KFGX8G3	white :: Choosing the white color to paint the doghouse guarantees a more pleasant environment for the animal since, according to the results of the experiment, the temperatures oscillating between 41 and 43 degrees are the lowest in comparison with the other colors, so white is the appropriate color for the doghouse.
es_3RXCAC0YIT20QDHUGMI9471KGF6G8J	negro :: temperatura del aire on the table categories
es_3RXPCZQMQROIFDX9H19UPXEC4FM1GK	light gray :: will be neither too hot nor too dark
es_3RXPCZQMQROIFDX9H19UPXEC4YJG1Y	white :: In order not to overly dry out the hut.
es_3SITXWYCNXMUEXAR882NJVRGSDZBXM	dark gray :: The temperature in all studies for the color dark gray remains unchanged.
es_3SKEMFQBZ5I5SZDD6D3O2ZTDNL0K8H	grey claro :: Giris Claro
es_3SKRO2GZ734NHZTS7SU9NP659SVK1O	white :: White seems to be the color that absorbs less energy and keeps the air temperature more stable, the most ideal color for the dog's house is white, even so it is necessary some kind of insulating material to reduce the internal temperature.
es_3SLE99ER0PQJJSA69QQ8GG7R1DWBZJ	white :: The white color would affect the inside of the kennel making it colder than any other color. The results of the experiment indicate that the lighter the color, the lower the temperature of the kennel will be. Since dogs like to live in cooler temperatures, white would be the most appropriate color.
es_3SNLUL3WO60EA228UGGUDROHAFCLUN	white :: As can be seen in the experiment and in the results obtained above, the darker the color of the lid, the higher the temperature we will obtain. We can reach this conclusion if we take into account the frequencies of light and how much light is reflected. The darker the color, the more light will be absorbed and therefore the higher the temperature will be obtained. That is why, if we want to obtain a higher temperature inside the house, we must select the darkest paint, in this case the black color. However, to avoid too much heat inside the house, it would be advisable to choose a lighter color, which in this case would be white.
es_3T3IWE1XG80A1M3WMGYGPH190L5QTU	white :: White attracts less solar energy, obtaining a lower temperature than black, which attracts more energy.
es_3TEM0PF1Q7AFW420JS4M57S5IZ60DG	white :: At first glance I would say White, however it also depends on the ambient temperature outside. With an extreme heat the ideal color would be White, and with an extreme cold, the ideal color would be Black. Greetings!
es_3TEM0PF1Q7AFW420JS4M57S5KLQD0N	white :: It was hypothesized that dark colors would absorb light and increase the temperature. Since the air temperature measured inside the container increased with darker colors, this is clear. Heat transfer occurs through conduction from the ceiling and convection of the interior air.
es_3TGOYF991ZZHTSP23U8V4EK0L3SUU5	white :: In all three tests, the average temperature of the white color was 10 degrees lower than the average temperature of the black color .
es_3TMFV4NEPARWNZ7UVRMRQAN8BBG8WB	white :: White color would keep the temperature inside the house low. The black cap bottle has the lowest temperatures.
es_3TOK3KHVJVVKICT9U03BVGERW9F7OI	white :: White color will help to reflect a little bit of temperature outside the interior but keep it in good temperature at night.
es_3TOK3KHVJVVKICT9U03BVGERXTOO7D	white :: The darker the color of the kennel, the more it will attract and absorb the sun's rays, causing the kennel to reach unhealthy temperatures for your pet in summer. For this reason, painting the kennel white would be the most appropriate since the sun's rays would not be absorbed by the kennel since it is outside.
es_3TOK3KHVJVVKICT9U03BVGERXXDO7A	white :: If you use white paint, the temperature inside the doghouse will be lower than if you use other darker colors such as gray or black.
es_3TS1AR6UQSRQCZGGVXKL8M5D2IRF7P	white :: one can notice that the darker the color, the warmer the thermometer measures. In the case of the hut to have a lower temperature, one would have to use the lighter color possibly.
es_3TS1AR6UQSRQCZGGVXKL8M5D2LAF7E	white :: the white color would make the kennel much cooler for your dog since the picture indicates that it is a lower temperature percentage.
es_3TU5ZICBRFER32B8JINLYL5MK498Q2	black :: The black color would help to keep the house temperature higher than with the other colors.
es_3TVRFO09GMS6R6W3ZLRHXYNL680LXA	black :: The black color would make the temperature inside the house higher (the average temperature after the 4 tests is higher). Being an outdoor shelter (and assuming a cold climate), the black color would be appropriate.
es_3TVSS0C0E3DFLJZIYPXMH6JVR5JWT6	white :: according to the results of the experiment the white color generated less heat inside the container based on the results the decision for the white color was made.
es_3U088ZLJVM6E5A2R0N9CXVHQU3X0WR	black :: NEGRO COLOR
es_3U0SRXB7CFICIADC2Z14L85M5MPNRN	white :: The white paint reflects much more radiation from the lamp, therefore the inside of the house will be kept at a lower temperature than if black paint were used.
es_3U4J9857OGO0ZI40QVYPPWESQRY7BF	black :: The temperature of the house using the black color is going to be higher because after three tests this is the only color that has consistently disassembled from having a temperature of more than 50 degrees Celsius.
es_3U4J9857OGO0ZI40QVYPPWESSJ0B77	white :: It is important that the inside of the kennel is cool, as you can add a blanket in case it is too cold, but it is difficult to reduce the temperature. As the experiment showed that the white color caused the interior to be cooler, you should paint the doghouse white.
es_3U5JL4WY5MMATYPITTS0BHLAFMDX4W	white :: I think that, if the doghouse is intended to protect the dog from heat and sun, the cover should be white because it would absorb less energy and therefore the inside would be cooler. If, on the contrary, the doghouse is to protect the dog from the cold, in that case the cover should be black, it would absorb more heat and light and the inside would be warmer.
es_3U5NZHP4LTFZW1BMM922BT8BNCMPHR	white :: as can be seen in the tests, white is the color that least increases the interior temperature of the can, so applying this rule to the color of the doghouse, the ideal color is white, which has been shown to be the color that least increases the interior temperature.
es_3U84XHCDIEQZYTPXUBGL821LSUR4Z1	white :: The darker the color of the cover, the higher the temperature inside the kennel.  It is less important for the animal that the temperature is stable and does not rise abruptly, the lighter the color the better.
es_3U84XHCDIEQZYTPXUBGL821LSXAZ4L	white :: If it is desired to repel the external heat inside the house, the suitable color will be white because of its low heat energy absorption capacity, as shown in the graph made as a result of the previous experiment.
es_3UN61F00HY28SL76YZ5IRR50HEVR50	white :: the test results indicate that white absorbed the least light, and therefore heated the least. That is why it has the lowest average temperature.
es_3UOUJI6MTFR9AWJX8ZJIOLJ4H0KXU7	light grey :: black
es_3UXUOQ9OKGAVG8Z8KHYTULUMDW0A7P	dark gray :: Dark gray would be an excellent color for the exterior of the doghouse but would affect the interior temperature when exposed to the sun since according to the results of the experiment, dark gray tends to increase the interior air temperature.
es_3V5Q80FXIZ4OAM3H5Q2OBMZ8OC623T	dark gray :: This color is better than black because it keeps the temperature at a comfortable level for the pet. Black would be too warm because the pet's body is warmer. The dark gray will not be very warm but it will keep the temperature more regulated.
es_3VA45EW49P067QE75KM2U6NESX01OJ	light gray :: According to experiments, the color white reflects a lot of light and reduces heat absorption. In an environment where the dog would like to keep cool in the shade, white is the ideal color, since it will allow the inside of the kennel to be at a lower temperature than if it were painted black.
es_3VAR3R6G1REOIQYS45VH9GAM6N18O9	white :: with this color the house will be cooler
es_3VAR3R6G1REOIQYS45VH9GAM8D3O89	black :: The black color had the largest results of the others.
es_3VBEN272MMCI9XW3UKOELY1LQB5SGP	dark gray :: it will give more xalor to the house because the solar energy will enter more to the interior because it is darker. It was also the color with the same score so the variety would be the same.
es_3VHP9MDGRPXWOGBCMESWO8XRA75FC4	black :: color may be white
es_3VP0C6EFSI9DE9USYAJ6XYPQCS0M6X	black :: black can affect the interior of the house, increasing the temperature of the room, had the highest average temperature after 10 minutes inside the glass jar.
es_3VP0C6EFSI9DE9USYAJ6XYPQCX76MY	white :: According to this table the perfect color is white. Because the tests 1 and 2 and 3 are the perfect combination in this color, the means also match perfectly. So painting jerry is perfect to choose is white.
es_3W8CV64QJ4CE4EVF5K65P38WE8G9HO	white :: Avoids excessive temperature increase inside the kennel, ensuring a warmer environment for the dog.
es_3WAKVUDHUYTFVHD6QMFKUM6GC9ZU74	light gray :: The dog house should not overheat, so I should choose a light color. With light gray the temperature will be cool, but not too cold. There is about 12 degrees difference between the highest temperature (black) and the lowest temperature (white). It's a very drastic change, and a white house can be too cold in winter. That's why I chose light gray.
es_3WAKVUDHUYTFVHD6QMFKUM6GCOSU7R	light gray :: LIGHT GRAY BECAUSE IT WOULD KEEP TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED
es_3WI0P0II6353WYMZD5N1P3TSTGQRDA	black :: Black color would absorb light
es_3WMOAN2SRDA4BHUTBJ6EM5UPQ0FVNH	white :: Definitely the black color absorbs the light and heat that radiates from the lamp, that is why to keep the house cooler it is better to use white color.
es_3WOKGM4L73T601TP91I2G144QZFO0F	white :: White generally reflects light rather than absorbs it. Although the experiment shows that the air outside still gets warmer, but it never rises to the level of black. I think if the temperature stays lower outside, it will also stay cooler inside the box.
es_3WQQ9FUS6C74ZW9J00QV3WAN05R8BD	white :: high contrast
es_3WR9XG3T65OGEJJRBGO2HI8MJNH47L	black :: Using a black lid could increase the temperature of the inside of the house. Based on the results of the experiment, we can observe that the interior with the black lid shows the highest temperature consistently.
es_3WRFBPLXRC1KZ8SAR9083A260GV3N2	white :: If the color is white, there will be less heat inside the kennel because the results show that if the color is lighter, the lid absorbs less heat. I assume that Brandi and Jerry don't want their dog to die from hyperthermia.
es_3WYGZ5XF3YSNBJSMKB9TJQTE0PVSKY	White :: By choosing white color for the house paint, it is less warm and more comfortable for the dog. Or by choosing a darker color such as black, the temperature inside the house will increase, which is not good.
es_3WYGZ5XF3YSNBJSMKB9TJQTEXSNSKT	black :: for sure the black color will absorb more energy therefore heating the interior to a higher temperature.
es_3X08E93BHXVBP690BUCP82S4F6B66I	white :: If the darker the lid of the canister the more heat condenses inside the container, the doghouse should be as light in color as possible so that the sun's rays do not cause the temperature to rise.
es_3X1FV8S5JZ4Y1PD7OFTJWLLSSLZGVX	white :: Based on the results the darker the color the more it affects the temperature.  The white color shows that it was the least affected.
es_3X3OR7WPZ1DGC5VVRDFPHZ6SF8RL8K	white :: The dog house should be comfortable. The white color absorbs less heat and therefore white is the best choice. The darker the more it absorbs heat, according to the results.
es_3X4JMASXCOMMH74G5WDGAH45JU9B0Z	light gray :: LIGHT GRAY IS THE BEST CHOICE BECAUSE IF IT IS COLD THE DOG WILL BE PROTECTED FROM THE COLD AND IF IT IS WARMER THE DOG WILL HAVE A BETTER TEMPERATURE IN HIS KITCHEN.
es_3X4MXAO0BI1254MQU0SRHRIDZ6ARWG	black :: With the roof of the hut painted black and, considering the results of the experiment, it can be assumed that the temperature inside the hut will be higher than with the other colors when the hut is under direct sunlight. This assumption does not take into account the effect of possible air flows in the hut as the hut is not totally closed like the boat in the experiment described.
es_3X73LLYYQ3RZTGZ96UPA743GL3PHN1	white :: this answer is easy I will be brief at my university in the interior lighting class I learned the above mentioned light colors are the best for the interior part because they allow to spread the temperature and the light emitted by the lamp.
es_3X73LLYYQ3RZTGZ96UPA743GNXGHNI	Depending on the size and breed of our dog we will differentiate 3 types of doghouses: doghouses for big dogs, doghouses for medium dogs or doghouses for small dogs. The perfect doghouse for your dog is the one that allows him to enter without any problem, to get up inside, to go for a walk when he is inside and to go to bed. If, on the other hand, we buy a doghouse that is too big, it will be more difficult to heat and our dog could become cold, especially in winter where temperatures are usually more extreme.
es_3X87C8JFV8O9MMQHXGTQFC5NX7HQS4	white :: Assuming that the sun is directly over the kennel, based on the results of the experiment, the ideal color is white, as it will allow the lowest possible temperature for the dog on hot days.
es_3XC1O3LBOUZZAPNJUBQK8V2FOBWLT4	white :: White is the best color because it maintains a more pleasant temperature for the dog.
es_3XIQGXAUMEL7CL71VRQ7ET5K667X7K	dark gray :: color could affect the inside of the hut. Use the results of the experiment
es_3XXU1SWE8O8HYXZOZIDKF6KZYNI0A6	black :: If the dog lives in a cold region, the color black in his kennel can help him to maintain a warmer temperature.
es_3Y5140Z9DZTZSWM6SRKNB59QL8PIP1	white :: Being white, it absorbs the least energy, so the house will stay cool during the hot summer, as shown in 1 and 3, along with the average of 41 degrees Celsius. If the ideal color for the winter would be black, so as to absorb as much energy as possible and keep the house warm.
es_3Y54SXRO1NY2TFAD3PILZIYY3OJUTB	white :: The white color will absorb less energy, thus making the inside of the kennel at a lower and more comfortable temperature for the animal.
es_3Y9N9SS8L0OBDW1X2FM575QCTZO3DW	white :: It will keep the house a little cooler.
es_3YDGXNSEO17KEXOALLG8VI4HOCP84I	white :: Color has a great effect on the house. The darker the color, the warmer the house will be. So white is the best color for the dog house.
es_3YDTZAI2WZT23X4PM07TG8H9A9614K	white :: White paint absorbs less energy than gray or black paint. As can be seen from the experiment, the temperature inside the glass jar with white lid was the lowest compared to the black and gray lids. Therefore, the white paint color is the best choice for the doghouse as it would keep the inside of the doghouse at a lower temperature compared to the black and gray paint.
es_3YDTZAI2WZT23X4PM07TG8H9CYT41Q	black :: The house would decrease in value.
es_3YGXWBAF72UMQ0EN2XWDX400MYO4CW	dark gray :: Dark gray leaves the temperature at the level.
es_3YJ6NA41JDTVN76CA95NN6OQZDZJPG	white :: white is the ideal color because it brings neither too cold nor too hot temperatures.
es_3YMTUJH0DUT3CHGYOJR3ME042S5T4T	black :: the darker the better
es_3YOH7BII0BK33B9QE6EYUDDL1JBKVZ	white :: The white color resulted in the lowest temperature inside the boat. A doghouse will be under the sun all day long, and it must be kept cool for the dog to be comfortable. For this reason, painting the kennel white is the best choice.
es_3YT88D1N0ABJR277UW8SBIL26RC3KV	dark gray :: The color and darkness will not affect the interior too much. Because the dark gray color will allow enough light to enter to maintain a neutral temperature.
es_3YW4XOSQKSY1KVY416YBTCF3DNNU1Z	white :: Will prevent the temperature inside the house from getting too hot.
es_3Z3ZLGNNSK75255271SP74XB4IV3QJ	white :: White would be the ideal color to keep the house temperature for the dog as cool as possible. Color selection could affect other aspects, such as increased visibility of dirt.
es_3Z7EFSHGNBRDO22XM8YIUFXY74HCXL	white :: The best color to use is definitely white. In fact, this prevents excessive overheating to avoid burns. This happens because white deflects light particles and overheats less.
es_3Z7ISHFUH280HUCZ6E6YPEHQPAL8ZT	white :: The only effect of white is that in all the tests it maintains a temperature below the other tests, since it is a light color and the clarity makes it reflect the temperature and does not reach a high temperature.
es_3Z7VU45IP0UI6USE7TXJA4UIHVZZ18	white :: The white color will keep the temperature inside the shelter from being too high, because it reflects the light.
es_3ZPPDN2SLX92K44DFJYZ40BJTS39EU	grey claro :: Grey Claro
es_3ZSANO2JCHKCVX08J0IW3D19T52FSW	white :: because the darker the color, the warmer the environment will become for the doghouse, if a light color such as white is used, it will heat up less because it will reflect the sun's heat more easily.
es_3ZSY5X72NZOU0VDO3E1H0X5RVV3ROD	light gray :: According to the results of the previous experiment, the darker the color, the warmer the object will be. Light gray seems to me an appropriate color because the object, in theory, would have a regular temperature.
es_3ZV9H2YQQFKAM21OJARVZTFXSMO3W5	white :: the white color is the one that absorbs less energy, therefore it will be the one that will give less temperature inside the doghouse.
es_3ZWFC4W1UWK0UI0V4BIRD3WD37ERFJ	white :: it has been scientifically proven that the white color is 22% less hot than the black color, therefore it would be the most convenient for the doghouse, since it would keep it as cool as possible.
es_3ZWFC4W1UWK0UI0V4BIRD3WD3V9RFQ	dark grey :: Dark grey is the best option, it keeps the dog warm but not too warm as with black. In the end it all depends on the climate. If it is a hot climate then white paint is the best option but if it is a cold environment then black or dark gray are the best options.
