en_004066	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.
en_004067	A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.
en_004068	The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic was plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic.
en_004069	a. Conclusion: type a plastic stretched the most. ^p b. The student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial.
en_004070	a) Plastic type A and B stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stayed the same.^p b) The student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight. Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.
en_004071	A.) Based on the data of the table, I conclude that plastic B was the most stretchable. In both trials it proved to be always above 20mm. ^P B.) The student could've used different clamps in his trials, this would've expanded the student possibilities with the plastics. To help with the validity, the student could explain what he did different. For trial T2, for the measures are not the same as T1 except for plastic type D, in both trials the measures were the same.
en_004072	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic B was the strongest. Plastic B was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretched to 23mm. To improve the experiment design the student could state a length they want the sample plastic to be. In the procedure the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in.
en_004073	A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment
en_004074	B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.
en_004075	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.
en_004076	a. Based on the data, the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type B, because in the both trials, it stretched the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.) Add more trials to increase accuracy of the results. 2.) Repeat the experiment with heavier weights to see if it affects the results.
en_004077	a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.
en_004078	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.
en_004079	Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.
en_004080	a. Plastic Type B stretched the farthest in both trials. Type D stretched second farthest in each trial and C and A stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. They also could've used more specific types.
en_004081	In conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B because it hangs longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. maybe put something else than weight, I think scissors.
en_004082	a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic because it's the most stretchable unlike type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do another trial and add heavier weights.
en_004083	Trial 2 was the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first time. The most stretchiest was plastic B it has the most stretch than the others. ^p The student could've kept it hanging maybe a little bit longer.
en_004084	3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers.
en_004085	A) When dealing with different types of plastic to find out their strechability, I found that plastic type A that 1 had the least amount of stretchability, with only 10mm, whereas plastic type B, trial two out measured A, C, and D's stretchability with 25mm!^p B) 1. He could've specified the names of the plastics, 2. He could've specified the weights added and made sure they're the same.
en_004086	A.D was the most and stayed the same tril 1 and tril 2.^p (B)He should of done another tril to make sure if he got different/ same results.
en_004087	Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most, plastic type A did the least amount of stretching. ^p They could have used more trials. They also could have added on more weight over a period of time.
en_004088	There is only two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is by telling the day or hour of the experiment, and see if the student's hypothesis was correct or not.
en_004089	The students that could of have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results its make sure all their supplies are there put the data table in order, and follow the time as instructed.
en_004090	(A) Plastic type B was the superior in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p (B) Record the weight that was put on to show how much effected each plastic. Also conducting more trials and making a larger graph to show the growth and change of each plastic.
en_004091	The plastic streatures more or less depending on the type could have reapeated it again to see what would happen used types of plastic.
en_004092	Based on the student data all different types of plastic was stretch more than others. Plastic B stretch the farthest, plastic A stretched the lowest. You can conclude that plastic B was the better plastic for the polymer investigation. ^p 1 Way) student could have changed or tested the different plastics at different times. (way 2) Remove the weight from 2 plastics and leave the other 2 with to see the outcome difference.
en_004093	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretched the least, making it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results. 2. The student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic.
en_004094	A conclusion that I can draw from this data is that plastic type B, stretched the most on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed, and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored, and controlled.
en_004095	a) Polymer plastic type B has the highest stretchability. It had 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. None of the other types of plastics stretched further than 20mm on either trial. ^p b) The student could have tested more types of plastic or made more trials to improve the experiment.
en_004096	I concluded that plastics A and B strech the most. One way the students could have improved the design is by stating how much weight they were adding. Another way is if they recorded a control for validity.
en_004097	"A. Based on the data plastic D isn't very stretchy because it was the same length in both trials. It didn't vary by even an inch. Plastic B must be stretchy because it stretched the largest in both trials. B. They could have included more trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastics (before being stretched) so you could compare ""see how much each one stretched."
en_004098	3. a) Plastic type A stretched the most C. b) They could of had more trials and used more types of plastic.
en_004099	For the conclusion it wasn't a big difference from the (T1) and (T2). It was more like 1 or 2 amount stretched from the first trial we did the procedure 2 times and have got different things most of the time.^p They could have had an empty plastic cup hanging from the plastic type to see it there was much difference. The could have also don a third trial just to see if there was much difference.
en_004100	The group can conclude that plastic type B, is the most effective type of plastic. According to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results. Along with that being said, the group also should have measured the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results.
en_004101	A) Our expirament was successful. Some of the plastic that we stretched out increase during trial 2. ^p B) They could have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table.
en_004102	Based on the student's test, plastic type B is the best. Plastic type B has the highest stretchability in both test. The students could've improved their expirements by adding weights till the plastic broke & performing a different test in trail 2.
en_004103	a) I can conclude based on the students data, that plastic type B was the most stretchable. And plastic type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was be, first of all, describing what kind of tape was used because simple, weakest tape would probably, not work in this situation. The best kind of tape might be duct tape, scratch tape, or measuring tape. So that needs to be specified. Also, the student should have told us the exact amount of weight that should be used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The design needs to be more specific.
en_004104	The plastic type A, B increases except plastic C & D. Plastic A increase from 10 mm to 12mm, plastic B increases from 22mm to 23 mm, plastic D stayed the same 20mm, 20mm, plastic  C decrease from 14 mm to 13 mm. ^p One way to improve this experiment is to allow them to hang for more time , Another way is to run more than two trials.
en_004105	A) Based on the conclusion of the students data they took 4 pieces of plastic taped them to an edge of adesk, claped wieghts to them and let them hang for 5 minutes. Then measured them to see how long they have stretched. They did this twice for all four types of plastics. So they got two results for all of the plastics. B) Two ways the students could of improved their experimental design are one had at, the same amount of weight on the different types of plastics. Also they could of had more trials so they could of had more results.
en_004106	a) A conclusion i can make base on this data is that all the specific plastic types had very different effects by either growing, shrinking, or staying the same.^p (b)Two ways the student could have proved the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used.
en_004107	I conclude that plastic type A has the most stretchability because from T1 to T2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh. Another improvent needs to be in step 5. The student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy.
en_004108	The different plastic type stretched different A. plastic A in the T1 they stretched less the the T2 in the plastic B in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial C the trial, they stretched more than the trial 2. D they are equal.^p B. The two ways the student could have improved to the experimental design or validity of the results is add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the other is and then measure the length of the plastic types.
en_004109	The student could have impoved this by being more specific for example the could say how long the piece of plastic is how much weight is being added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used.
en_004110	Based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched, one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. One way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were. And second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after.
en_004111	Based on the data one can conclude that plastic type B has the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is greater than any other types. ^P Two ways that the student could've improved the validity of the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to every polymer.
en_004112	"The polymer plastic type A & B were stretch 2mm more after trial 2. Plastic type C & D  obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch. Plastic type ""C"" decrease 1 mm while plastic type ""D"" stayed the same. They could of improved there validity by mentioning how many weights they used for each trial & also stating the different type of polymer plastics."
en_004113	A) Plastic B has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic I have tested. The least stretched plastic is plastic type A which was at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretched to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C was at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D was at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability. B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. Another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area.
en_004114	Based on the data plastic B stretched the most out of all the plastics. So plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the four plastics. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it only stretche10-12mm and plastic B stretched 22-23mm. The students should have stated how much weight was more used and if they used the same amount of weights for each plastic. Also the plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity.
en_004115	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength because it stretched the farthest in both trials, and plastic type A has the least tensile strength, because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b) The students could have indicated how many millimeters of plastic should be taped on top of the table, and indicated how heavy each weight should be.
en_004116	The conclution would be that plastic type D has streched the most and that plastic type A had streched the least. One way the student could have improved the experement would be to tell people the mass of the weights used. Another thing the student could have done was to list the starting length of the plastic in his data table.
en_004117	"A conclusion based on the students data is ""B"" and ""D"" were measured out to be in the low both. ""A"" and ""C"" were measured in the laend. One way they could of improved the design is meseric the length of tin plastic before they added weight B. A second way they could improve this design is tell us in the procedure when to measure after adding the weights on."
en_004118	In the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability. In this experiment, plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. The results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment. To improve this experiment, I would run a third and fourth trial to develop an average amount stretched for each plastic type. Additionally, I would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched.
en_004119	"My conclusion would be that plastic A would be the most resistant plastic and plastic plastic B would be the stretchiest plastic . One way the student could have improved the validity of the results could have been to run more trials for the samples of plastic. One way to improve the experimentol design would be to change step 6"" to repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining three plastic samples'', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure."
en_004120	A) Based on the student data I conclude that plastic type B was the stretchiest of all plastics because in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both times which was higher for any other plastic. ^P B) The student could have improved this experiment by having a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastics and he should have had a control group.
en_004121	The experiment shows that plastic type B has the most tensile strength, since it would have done to improve the experiment are to specify the amount of weight  added and give specific starting length for each plastic, perfeably the same length for each.
en_004122	Freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type B stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity. They could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant. Also they could add more trials to increase the validity.
en_004123	A. Based on the results of the experiment, I believe that plastic C will take the most weight. All the other plastics either extended when more weight was added or stayed the same. Plastic C though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic A which went from 10 to 12 and B which went from 22-23 mm and lastly D witch remained at 20 mm the whole duration. ^p B: A way the student could of improved the experiment validity is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length.
en_004124	I conclude that plastic type B has a stronger materials compared to the other types. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more trials, another way it would have been better is by saying how much weight was being used.
en_004125	Plastic type B stretches the most. The students could have said how much heights they put on the plastics. They could of also mentioned the amount of time the weights were on the ruler they could of said now much tape to use.
en_004126	Based on the students data, type D's length stayed the same in both trials. Also type B had the highest length, and type A the smallest. This lab could be improved by stating the purpose of the second trial. Also, since there are 2 trials, the lengths should be averaged. There also should have been a percise number of weights added.
en_004127	In conclusion it seems that the plastic type B's outcome of amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three.^p State what length you're excepting to keep them the same.^p Also for better results the students should have done a third trial to be on the safe side.
en_004128	a) T2 the amount that was stretched in was more than the amount in T1. ^p b) The student could have estimated 2.
en_004129	A= As the students where doing the right thing but they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more. ^p B=The could have improved it by writing how many times they did it and record how long they did it for.
en_004130	"In conclusion plastic type B proved to be the most strechable (after 5 mins)  reaching ti 22 $ 23 mm stretched. Howevwr plastic type A proved to be the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial and 17 mm in trial 2. Plastic type B proved to be the second least strechable and 20 mm at both trials  and type C proved to be the second least strechable. After five minutes in trial 1 it was 14mm long and in trial two it was 13 mm long, ""A"" was the least stretchable while ""B"" was the most stretchable."
en_004131	"The data table showed us that plastic type  ""B"" had stretched the most out of all other plastic type materials. This exiperement could have more trails and more in formation of their producerse."
en_004132	(a) According to the student's data plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial.^p (b). The student should have specified how much the weights weighed and how many of them to put on the clamp.^p The student should have specified what they were measuring the length of the plastic types with.
en_004133	The plastic type did have an effect on the amount stretched. As the plastic stretched from A to D the amount stretched in mm changed from 10 to 20 on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial. I say plastic B stretched the best becaused it stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm the first and second trials. ^P The students expirement was not valid. They could of done more trials. They could of told us what type of plastic they used.
en_004134	based on the experiment data, I can conclude that plastic B has the greatest stretchability by stretching 22 & 23 mm. the least stability plastic was A of only 10 & 12mm. ^p The students could have improved the experience by adding independent/ dependent variables, and completed 3 trials all with equal weights.
en_004135	The plastics stretched a small amount in most in some stayed the same.^p He could of added more weights.^p Waited more times.
en_004136	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest, therefore it is the most flexible, stretchable or most likely thinnest of all four plastic types. Type B finished with 22mm in the first trial and 23 in the second trial. The least stretchable plastic type, type A finished with 10mm in the first trial and 12 in the second trial. ^p b) This student should've identified the length which all four plastic samples should be to ensure that each is given a fair trial. Also, the student should classify the size, shape and amount of materials used preferably. Each type of material should be identical in ensure accuracy.
en_004137	So  in this lab I recorded four types  of plastic type bags. Also I recorded the amount stretched in the four types of bags. I did two tries each. Two things they could improve is their procedure list their data table. Also their results of the amount stretched.
en_004138	a. The students data concludes that plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b. The student could have made all the plastics the same starting length and added the same amount of weights each time.
en_004139	a) based on the student's data I can conclud that plastic type A stretched the least at 10mm T1 and 10mm on T2. plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm on T1 and 23mm on T2. b) Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp.
en_004140	a) Based on the student's data. Plastic type D was the one that stretched the most making it the most durable. For example, plastic A only stretched 10mm, while D stretched to 20mm. Also, the second trial was important because for plastic A.C, different amounts of length was recorded.^p b) One way to improve the experiment design is to tell how many weights are added to the clamps and how heavy they are. The students can then use these weights to test another trial which would make the design better. Because plastic D stretched the same amount in both trials, it'll be best to create a third trial for each plastic.
en_004141	The conclusion that was made is that plastic type B stretched more in both trials compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic Type got 22 and 23 mm for both trials while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials. The student must include in the procedure the amount of weight to add for step 4. Also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do?
en_004142	Based on the data I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most out of any of the other plastics.^p Two ways that the student could have improved the design and /or validity of the results are by telling us what types of plastics). Second the student should have added a third part to the table, how much weight was being applied.
en_004143	The plastic type (B) stretched out the more in both trials than the other types of plastic.^p One way they could improve their experiment was to tell us how much weight they used on the clamps.^p Another one is they could have written down the length of plastic before they started to see the difference.
en_004144	There  wasn't much of a difference between (T1) and (T2). It only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same. One way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial. Another way the student could have improved the experiment is by using several other materials not just plastic.
en_004145	Based on the students data you can conclude that Plastic B stretched the farthest and Plastic A stretched the least. Two ways this student could have improved this experiment is by providing the start length of each plastic before the weights are added. Another thing they could do to improve this experiment is to include the weight that was added to the clamp for each plastic.
en_004146	a. Based on the student's data, plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p b. First, the students should have mentioned what type of plastic to use to replicate the experiment, and it seems they used the same pieces of plastic for each type on both trials, which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial may have stretched the plastic out too much for the second trial.
en_004147	Based on the students data, my conclusion would be that T2 got more results than T1. Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design by giving more results, and measurements.
en_004148	a) Based on the data, the polymer plastic B is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the validity of the trial could be to add one or two more trials. Also, he could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot.
en_004149	Plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights. ^p The student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant. They also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Both of these would help improve the validity of the data.
en_004150	The conclusion of this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the most with 23 (mm) with trial. ^p 2. A way to improve this experiment is clarify what the plastics is tested for and if it needs to be stretchy or not stretchy. Also to use different amounts of weights to see what the main stretch is. Also a control in this experiment to compare to could help.
en_004151	Based on the students data you can conclude that for the most part all four types of plastic had almost the same length at mm stretched to the two trials. ^p Two ways the student can improve the experiment is that they could say what the starting length for each plastic type would be or they could increase the amount of time the plastic hangs from the table by.
en_004152	Well based on the student data plastic type B was the plastic that stretched the most on both trys. One way that student could the valdity of her expirment would to have a control. This way you have somthing to test the other results against.
en_004153	Based on the conclusion plastic type B resulted in the most stretched T1-22, T2-23. concluding that 1/4 it was the most strongest.The students should have added a specific amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type lastly the student should have performed the second trial with different measurement.
en_004154	Plastic type B was the most stretchable and A was the least. Want longer than 3 min when adding the weights. Add more weights.
en_004155	The results seem pretty good. And I think that he could have done more data and more samples.
en_004156	From the students data table, one can conclude that plastic type 'B' and 'D' are more elastic  / are able to stretch more than plastic types 'A' and 'C'. The students could have improved their experiment by specifying and controlling the amount of weight added to each clamp and mentionity and maintaining the beginning dimensions of the polymer that subjects  (including thickness.)
en_004157	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data can be that plastic type D has the most stretchability in both trials.^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics original length before the trials. (2) If they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights.
en_004158	"From the graph shown I feel that plastic type ""B"" was more durable than the other plastic because at trial 1 it was the highest mm stretched and some for trial 2. ^P B. Two ways the student could have improved the design is to do more than just 2 trials. They could've also done it in different measurements."
en_004159	A. I could conclude from this students experiment that plastic B, was the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table.
en_004160	a) With the results provided, it is shown that plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second, compared to plastic A this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. B) The students should have specified the weights amount that was to be added to the plastic. They should have also said how much of the plastic should be taped to the table, different amounts could affect the amount of weight it could hold.
en_004161	In conclusson, plastic type D has the most stretchability. Two ways that students could improve the experiment is by having a control. They could also do more trials to receive a more acuret answer.
en_004162	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials. Therefore, it would most likely break faster than the others. Plastic type A stretched the least amount so, it would probably hold more before breaking. B) The students could have performed more trials. They could've also, use the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic. It doesn't say how much weight they used, just to add weights.
en_004163	a. In conclusion if I take a sample of a type of plastic and measure its length then add weight to it and wait 5 minutes to see how much it is now.^p b. Two ways the student could have improve the experimental design is to add more trials. Another thing they could of did was try is add more thing for the weights.
en_004164	The students doing polymer lab can now know plastic type B had stretched the most and plastic type A had stretched the least. The second polymer had the greatest stretchability. Two ways they could have improved the design is taking the plastic over a cylindrical surface thats open and put weights on it to see if that affects it more. Also for better validity of their data they could've put how the plastic measured before and after instead of already skipping to the math part.
en_004165	In the data tables there are four different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights, within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type b had the longest trail. They could have told us what type of plastic wrap they used and they should have more trials.
en_004166	a)My conclusion is that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all the tested plastics. I came to this conclusion because as you see on the graph on T1 it reached 22 and T2 23 which was higher than all the other plastics tested.^p (b) They could have did more trials because the more they do, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, in the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use.
en_004167	(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretched the most, so it would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Telling what kind of plastics they used were: ^p     2 Be more detailed by how long they stretched it for.
en_004168	Overall plastic B stretched the most followed by plastic D, C, then A. This lab needs a lot of work for it to be valid. First the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics need to be on the table because although plastic B is the longest in the end, it may have started at 20mm, but we don't know. Also they should do more trials.
en_004169	What I can conclude from the groups results is that polymer B has the least amount of resistance  to stretching. I know this because, plastic type B stretched an average length of 22.5 mm, this is larger than the three other plastics. Also, plastic type A had the most resistance to stretching because it only stretched an average length of b11mm. There is two ways to add validity and impede the experimental design. One way is to add a control to the groups and second, to have specific measurements for the amount of weight being added.
en_004170	The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table.
en_004171	Based on the students data, plastics B and D are the most stretchable because they stretched the most in trial 1. Plastic B stretched 22 mm and plastic D stretched 20 mm. ^p The student could have specified how heavy the weights should be on the plastics. Also the student must use plastic samples of the same lengths so the results have more validity.
en_004172	What kind of plastic was it.
en_004173	You can conclude that plastic B stretched the most, and plastic A stretched the least. One way the experiment could be improvd is making sure each plastic is the same length before the stretch. Another is to do the experiment for different time intervals, like five, ten, and fifteen minutes instead of just five minutes.
en_004174	Based on the data, we can conclude that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One way the student could have improved this experiment, would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control.
en_004175	A conclusion I can draw based on the students data is that plastic type A stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type D didn't stretch at all but stretched the longest out of thin four types. One way that this design could have been improved is if the plastic types could have been named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make the experiment work better.
en_004176	Plastic D it not even strectch. ^p B- include sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags.
en_004177	The student's data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In the end the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to the experiment. Also more weighes on the plastics to have more accurate ressults.
en_004178	The students data is good the trial were coles in number. It seems that plastic type B was the streched with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trials helped the way. ^P I hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in. He said to put a weight on the end but how much.
en_004179	The conclusion of this investigation is that plastic type A is the most provable because it stretched the most out of the four types. The student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types that were the same length. Also the student could have extended the stand time for trial 2.
en_004180	a) The more weight that was added onto the plastic bag and one longer the weights were on the plastic bag, the more it had streched out. Out of all the plastic bags type D had the least amount of resistance to be streched, plastic bag type A had the most amount of resistance to be streched. ^P b) One way that the experiment could have been improved was the amount of weight could have been specified. A second way that the experiment could have been improved was more trials could have been conducted.
en_004181	a) Plastic types A & C are the least stretchy, whereas plastic types B & D are the most stretchy.^p 1 b) Define the original length as the plastic, and keep it constant for all four plastics. 2b) Use different sizes weights for the trial to see if their is a difference in data.
en_004182	A conclusion that be drawn from the data table is that the, plastic type B had the most weights although they could have improved their experiment by. Clamping are side to a table, which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width.
en_004183	a) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched more than plastic type A, C, & D. The purpose of this experiment was to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability. Data shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type A, but plastic B stretched more than all of the plastic types. The student could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure.
en_004184	a) Based on the recorded data, I am able to conclude that plastic B was a weak poly ethilen product in which it has the highest stretchability through out the experiment. ^p The group could deffinetly improve their design by having each sample of plastic at a constant length, therefor your results are more valid. Also the group could create intervals of time to show the results after 5, 10, or 15 minutes to see the fluctuation.
en_004185	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude the B stretched the highest and A stretched the least. ^P b) The students could have told us how much the weights weighed. They also could have told us the original length of the plastic before stretching it.
en_004186	The student should have made the procedure less.
en_004187	a) I conclude that plastic B was the highest stretching plastic according to the graph it stretched 23mm, plastic A is the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two. ^P b) This experiment could have been improved by having each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic. The chart should include the original starting lengths of each of the plastics and the ending length.
en_004188	A.) Plastic type B stretched the most. ^p B.) They could have done multiple trials of each plastic.
en_004189	a) Basically these students are trying to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other how much weight it can take. ^p b) The first way the students could have improved is that the could have measure the plastic and the second way they could have improve is to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break.
en_004190	In conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small amount of stretchability. In the experiment the plastic was strech at least 1mor millameter greater in the second trial versus the first trial also plastic type D was the only plastic that had no change within the two trials. Know two things I would change is first have the starting lengths of the plastic to see the difference from start to finish. Also specify how much weight you are laying on the end of the plastic.
en_004191	In conclusion, the plastic type have more amout stretched that the other one in both trial. For example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23.
en_004192	A conclusion drown based on the students' data would be plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the validity of the results is to have each type of plastic start at the same length. The students could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of weights on each plastic.
en_004193	a) My conclusion is that plastic type  B is the most stretchable. ^p To make this experiment more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test.
en_004194	As shown in the data, most of the test subjects stretch by one, with so, this project was a success. ^p 1. He could have use more time on the weights. ^p 2. He could have use different weights.
en_004195	a. Plastic B stretched the most at an avarage of 22.5 mm. ^p b. Add more trials. Explain how much waights are they using. How much of tape to use.
en_004196	A) In conclusion it seems as though plastic type D was the weakest plastic being least, as it stretched 20mm in each trial. The strongest appears to be plastic A, which barely stretched; it was as an average of 11mm.^p b) One way that the student would've made this experiment was to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant, as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched. A second way the student could've improved these experiment would be to add weights and the drop of the bottom at the same time, then immediately start taking so all the vinegar being used is both constant as well as the amount of time it's left hanging pf the plastic.
en_004197	Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A stretched only 10 and 12 mm for each trial and plastic type B stretched 22 mm and 23 mm for each trial. ^p Two ways to improve this experiment. They probably should not use tape to hold the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights for different times.
en_004198	The conclusion of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial then the first trial.^p One was the student could have improved the experimental design is instead of using a  clamp, just use the weights. And a second way the student could have improved the experimental design measure all plastics before anything else.
en_004199	Based on the data table I can conclude that plastic type A was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most. Also that plastic type D was strongest due to the fact that it didn't stretch at all. A validity issue is that plastic type C had shrunk in size when the test was to see it stretch.
en_004200	a. The conclusion I came to is that plastic type D has the least strength there for it stretched the most. ^p The student could have specified how many weights to add into each clamp. The student also could've made each sample of plastic the same length so it would have been easier to measure and conclude how much the plastic stretched.
en_004201	A.) That type B plastic is the strogest type of plastic they used in this investigation. It held the same while streching the most.^p B.) One way they could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import. Also they did not state how much weight.
en_004202	3A) I would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment. They are all very close in the amount stretched when they are all the same plastic typed from T1 to T2. ^p 3b) And two way that a student could have improved the experiment was maybe having a T3 to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps till it broke to really see how much it stretched.
en_004203	My conclusion is that the numbers will go higher lowes and a way they can improve the trials is by putting more work in it, so it can be a good grade or data count.
en_004204	My conclusion is that for each plastic type it had stretched almost the exact same amount for both trials such as type D which had 20 for both trials. The students could have improved the experimental design by being specific as to how many weights should be added. They also should have written how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data.
en_004205	a. Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. The student should have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was added to the clamp. Also, the student could have experimented further by also testing the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes.
en_004206	a) The table doesn't tell you much about how much they exactly stretched, the students only put what I assume the end length of the marble. Nothing can really be told with this information.^p (b) They should mention the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also they should have mentioned this in the table. On the table, the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched.
en_004207	a) It is clear that plastic D is the least elastic and that plastic A is the most elastic plastic. ^p b) To improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third trial. And could have specified what the length was at each weight.
en_004208	a) In conclusion in the procedure it can be seen that plastic type A had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are in either add more weight to the plastics or to let the weight being off the plastics for more than five minutes.
en_004209	"A. The conclusion that I drew is plastic type ""B"" was the best plastic for stretchability"". ^P B. One way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much weight to add to the clamp. The results won't be as valid if one person adds a different amount of weight than another. ^P Another way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be taped to the table."
en_004210	Based on the students data for each trial, the amount of plastic stretched, it would first rise, decreased, then rise again. ^P B.) 1.) For the experimental design, they could have explained how much do the weights weighed. ^P 2.) The student should've showed what type of plastic he used.
en_004211	a) Plastic type B  is the plastic that stretched the most, plastic A was the one that stretched the least.^p b) The students can improve the experiment by adding another trial. Also we could have mentioned how much weight he put on the clamp.
en_004212	Based on the students data all of the types of plastics managed to stay around the same amount of being stretched. ^p I, the students could have shown constants, 2.)The students could have explained how the experiment was done a little bit more.
en_004213	Based on the students data I could conclude that the material that can stretch the most is plastic B. Thats because it was able to stretch 22mm the first trial and 23m  the second trial.^ (b)The students could have put the table what kind of plastics that were being used. In the procedure the students should have put how much the weight weighed.
en_004214	(1) He could of used the same amount of weight. ^p (2) Use a different conteince.
en_004215	The students data shows that plastic B stretched the most (22mm & 23 mm), however this may not be valid because you don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. The students can improve the results by using the same length for each plastic. Also, they can include how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to improve the experimental design.
en_004216	A)A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type D had the same amount stretched for trial one and two, which was 20(mm).^p (b)Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by keeping the sample piece of the type of plastics the same. Also to use the same types of weights.
en_004217	a. Based on the students data plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C didn't stretched it got stretch by 1mm and plastic D didn't change at all. ^P b. Two ways that the students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results is, first by making the procedures more clear. Second, to make it more accurate the amount of weight should be the same since you're not measuring that and plastics should of been made of the same type of material.
en_004218	In the students experiment it is clear that polymer B is the most stretchable, than D, C, and last A. The students could use more trials, with these the experiment becomes more valid. The students also could have said the size of the plastics sample, since the size is in the final measurement, this could alter the results by a lot.
en_004219	(a) Polymer based plastic D didnt stretch at all. Plastic A stretched the most. ^p (b) Run more trials to make sure you get the same or close results and let the weights sit on the plastic longer than five minutes to see if more time is givin will it strech more.
en_004220	"A) Plastic type A and B have increased in length from the first trial to the second trial. While type C have decreased and type D have remained the same length. B) Two ways would have to be ) add a certain amount of weights to hang instead of saying, in step 4, add ""weights"". Anyone who is recreating this experiment would have different amounts. And 2) add more trials, adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly."
en_004221	A) Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, at 22.5mm average.^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and the location on the table to put the tape, in case it is moved by the weights.
en_004222	A) B first the one plastic that's the stretchiest, while A is the least stretchiest C. ^P B) One way is by having a third trial to make shure, your data is corrected and by taking down how long the plastic was before you stretched it.
en_004223	Plastic B stretched the most for both trials.On trial one it stretched 22mm, on trial 2 it stretched 23mm.The plastic that stretched the least has plastic A. On trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 stretched 12mm. A way the student could have improved this is to add more weight to each plastic. And also another was to improve it is to have the plastics start at the same length.
en_004224	a) Based on the students data plastic type D is the constant and will always be ^p 20mm but B is stretchies. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved this would have been to indentify the types of plastic and how much weight was being added.
en_004225	In conclusion,the data shows that plastic. Type B has the best stretchability in this experiment. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used for the experiment. He could have listed the materials be used in the experiment.
en_004226	A. To conclude, based on the data plastic type B has the most stretchability. Plastic type B was able to stretch 22 and 23mm while the closest streched (plastic type A) stretched 20 and 20.^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by telling a specific amount of weight and by being specific on what type of plastics they are using.
en_004227	b)The first would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to understand the difference of both experiment/ second would be to conduct a longer time setting to see how long it last.
en_004228	"a) Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B has the highest stretchability i.e lasticity. This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only "" measuring the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, making the results more valid."
en_004229	In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer. These students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic, stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well.
en_004230	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results.
en_004231	a) You can't really draw a conclusion because, the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) They could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be.
en_004232	a) A good conclution for this would be that type be streched the furthest. ^P b) Two ways the students could have made this better would to have tested exactly what type of plastic to use and how long each peice should be.
en_004233	a.) In conclusion, plastic type A and B increased two or one mm. Plastic type C decreased one mm. And lastly plastic. Type D stayed the same. So the only affected ones were plastic type A, B, and C. ^p b.) One way the student could improve was to have another trial. And a second way the student could improve was to add different weights.
en_004234	The strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials. The weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials.  So two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps.
en_004235	(A) Based on the data graph it is clear the polymer B is the most strecthable because in T1 it stretched 22 cm and in T2 it strectched 23cm, beating the other polymers. ^p (B) The two ways they could have bettered this project is by 1, add more trials to it and 2. They could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment.
en_004236	My conclusion about this experiment is that T1 doesn't strech more than T2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic D or change.
en_004237	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic B has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2.5mm more than any of the other plastics. However, based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable. One way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control, for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic, to ensure that the independent variable, the plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the amount the plastic stretches.
en_004238	a) In conclusion putting the weights on each state, caused the plastic to stretch. It didn't stretch massively but it did make a difference. ^p b) One way the student could change it's experiment is by saying how much weight was on each state, or the student could have added the types of plastic samples.
en_004239	(a) The conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretched to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It was stretched 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improve the validity of the data, the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weights added to the clamp, keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results.
en_004240	Plastic type A had the least stretchability at an average of 11 mm while plastic type B stretched the most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p The amount of weight added should be included in the procedure to make the test more valid. Preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here.
en_004241	It was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most amount in both the second and first trial. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and having a control variables.
en_004242	Based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type A has the most strechibility while plastic type C was the least amount stretched in the two trials while plastic type A's amount streched increased 2mm. Plastic type B's amount streched decreased 1mm two ways the student could have improved the experiment of design and/or validity of the results would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways.
en_004243	A) Depending on the type of plastic will determine how much it will stretch with the added weights on it.^P B) The students could have tried it more times and they could have other types of plastic as well
en_004244	My conclusion are that plastic type B is the strechiest. It's the most durable and can hold the most height. ^P 1. Use the most durable tape you can find strong duet tape will probably be fine. ^P 2. Make sure all the plastic pieces are the same size and appropriate size.
en_004245	I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B) All the plastics should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is being put on the different types of plastics.
en_004246	Type D is the stretchiest & most constant of the plastics tells how much weight to put on clamps, tell how long the samples was.
en_004247	In conclusion, in trial2 the plastic stretched more than in trial .^p B) The students could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic and by allowing to let them hang longer.
en_004248	Plastic type B has the best stretchability. Plastic type D was in 2nd place with 20 mm for both trials. Plastic type C had 14mm for trial 1 and 13mm for trial 2. Plastic type A was the second. So plastic type B, with 22mm fro trial 1 and 23 for trial 2, is the winner.^p The students could have said how much weight is in the test. Another improvement could be to have 2 people and stretch the plastic, since stretchability is being tested.
en_004249	a) If plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic B will stretch the farthest. This is supported by the data because in T1 and T2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data.They also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment.
en_004250	a) According to the data, plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C was the second strongest, followed by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial.
en_004251	A) According to the students data, polymer B stretched the most. ^P B) The student should specify the exact amount of weight to be attached to the plastic. The student should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched, horizontally or vertically, because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic. For example, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom.
en_004252	A. In conclusion plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could've improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed.
en_004253	In trial 2 plastic type A stretched 2more millimeters than in trial , and plastic type D did not have any change. ^p The student could have completed more trials. Also the student could have how many weights before breaking.
en_004254	A) A conclusion is that plastic type B has stretched the farthest in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in trial 2 reaching 23mm. The other 3 plastic types did not stretch as far as plastic B.^P B) The student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics were before they were stretched and adding that data in the table. Also the student could have made sure each plastic was the same length and width before each of them were stretched. The student should have also listed the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic.
en_004255	A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that in both ones plastic type B has to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics. This data is not valid because there are many places within the experiment to increase the validity. The students could have recorded the starting length and ending length. Also they should have add the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial.
en_004256	Plastic B is the easiliest streached plastic. ^p They could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight. They could have tested more samples.
en_004257	A. Based on the student's data the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic, type B had the most stretchability.^p B. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to include exactly what plastics were used. Also they could have added what step weights they used to stretch the plastics.
en_004258	a) Based on the data ,I can assume that plastic B has the most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm.^p b) One way the student could here improved the experiment design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othey are constant .Also the student could have specified the amount of weight that was out on the clamp and the  student could also have made the amount of weight a constant.
en_004259	In trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn't a tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample A had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, while sample D had the most amount of millimeters and didn't change at all. ^p 1 Use different sample of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure they are all coming from same temperature.
en_004260	A)Plastic type B stretched more than any type in both of its trials. (B)The student could have made sure each plastic was the same size to begin with. Also the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions.
en_004261	Draw a investigation is meatanese.
en_004262	a) After recording the data, it is obvious that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit. Another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched.
en_004263	C. A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B, C are the most resistant. ^p The students could improve the experiment by trying it a third time, and saying the amount of plastic use for all 4 plastic used. This is how the students can improve the experiment to have a more valid result.
en_004264	Based on the students data, polymer plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because the millimeters stretched on B trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length. (control)
en_004265	a) The A plastic stretched the most while plastic C shrunk an inch and D did not stretch at all. B stretched an inch concluding that A was the most stretchable plastic. ^p b) They could have said how long to cut the plastic types and how much weight should be put on the clamp.
en_004266	Based on the information from the table, plastic type A has more stretchability than the rest. ^p The student could've tested longer because like I said before, time is a factor in determining things when testing. Also, the student should've added weights to the second trial.
en_004267	I can conclude that plastic B streatchs out the most and plastic A streachs out the least. I know this because plastic B streatches 22 to 23, and plastic A streachs 10-12. Two was to improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic, and to add four more trials.
en_004268	Plastic B is a material that is the most flexible. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is having a control and measure all the plastics the same length when the experiment initiated. A control will allow the student to compare data & the constant will increase the data's validity.
en_004269	A. The polymer material B was the best in stretchability. The polymer D was 3rd C was 2nd and A was the worst.^p B. 1. They could have gave the polymer more time to stretch instead of just 5 min. 2. They could have done test different polymers.
en_004270	The plastics did not stretch as much in trial 2 (T2) as they did in trial 1 (T1).^p The student could've explained what we were looking for maybe with a hypothesis. They also could've identified the plastic types.
en_004271	Based on the data shown in the table, I can conclued that plastic type D was to strech the most. Also that plastic type A streched the least. ^p The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials and by telling the types of plasic used for the experiment.
en_004272	The needed more trails. Also could more infomation, and the most streched ploymer was 23.
en_004273	It is a good experiment with nice ideas and it shows which plastic is most flexible. The first way to improve the test is to use different brand name plastics to test the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the lab is valid.
en_004274	Plastic type A is definately the streatchiest where as plastic type D is the least stretchy. The student could have improved his experiment in many ways. 2 of these ways include: letting the plastic stretch more. The students should have waited longer than 5 minutes. The other way he/she could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. The student only tested 4 types of plastics when there are many more.
en_004275	The plastic stretch out about the same they don't  have that much difference. The students could have kept adding weight to see how far the plastic would stretch. They should have gone deeper and actually figured out the exact difference.
en_004276	The student's data clearly shows tat plastic B has the most stretchability. In that one it stretching to 22 mm, and in trial two it stretched to 23. Plastic D was a close second with 20 mm for  both trials. Plastic C stretched 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second. Finally plastic A stretched the least. It is obvious that plastic B was the stretchiest in Comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second. To improve the experimental design of the students could make sure the pieces of plastic are the same length also they could use the same clamp and weights to ensure that the weigths added
en_004277	Based on the student's data, it is clear that plastic type B is the most stretchy because it was able to stretch 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type A was the least stretchable because it was only stretched 10mm and 12mm. This is a difference of about 10mm. ^p The students should have specified the length of the plastics making it consistent for all the different types would ensure a valid experiment in which only one variable was tested. Also, they should have given a specific weight to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid.
en_004278	A) A conclusion that could wiads from the students data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same number if it could be one higher or one lower. Also, the plastic type D is the most stretchable to both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by not only trying one experiment, testing it in four 1-10 trials. Also the student could have been more specific with the plastic types.
en_004279	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic A stretched the farthest out of all the other types during the second trial. Another conclusion would be that plastic type D didn't stretch at all and stayed durable, which means it's the strongest, throughout the 1st and the 2nd trial. Two ways this experiment would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials to test its validity and the other would be to identify the type of plastic and more importantly start at the same length of each plastic to keep the validity of the experiment valid.
en_004280	As you can see, plastic type A stretched the least and type B stretched the most. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment design would be to tell whatt. They are doing with the plastic and do a third trial. The purpose of the experiment is unknown.
en_004281	According to the students data we can now conclude that plastic B is the strechiest, Streching 22mm and 23mm on the second trial. But one way the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of plastic for both trials so your not using the same one. Another way it could be improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight is being used and specify that each plastic should use the same weight.
en_004282	a. In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable out of the group of plastic because in trial 1, plastic B stretched 22mm and in trial 2, plastic B stretched 23mm. This compares to plastic A, that stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12mm on the second trial, which was the least stretchable. ^p b) The students conducting this experiment could have named specific plastics instead of saying 'take a sample of plastic'. Also, the students could have taken measurements as the 5 minutes were passing. Multiple trials would have also helped prove the validity of this investigation.
en_004283	a) Conclusion - plastic Type A stretched the least and plastic Type D the most. ^p 1. name type of plastic being used 2. what kind of weights are being used.
en_004284	Based on the students data, plastic type B was the most flexible plastic A streches the least with an average growth of 11mm while in comparison, plastic B had an average strech of 22.5mm. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experiment design and be the validity of the experiment are, specify the a from of weight used and on another trial with heavier weights. This will further parsue the plan and make sure all data accurate. Another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiment is to start out with the same amount of each platic, instead of measuring different lengths to start with.
en_004285	In conclusion plastic type B had the best flexibility of 22-23mm amount stretched, while A had 10-12mm,C had 14-13mm,and D had 20-20mm stretched. So type B the best. Two ways improved their experiment is by using something other than a clamp, thats also add on weight ,and to show on their data table how much weight the stretch could withstand.
en_004286	Based on the student's data, I can make a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the most. Two way to improve this experiment for better results is on have a control. They also can have more trials to make it more valid.
en_004287	I can draw a conclusion that A had the best stretchability with T1=22 and T2=23. I am also conclude that plastic A had the best stretchability at T1=10, T2=12, what the student could have done to test her validity she could have had the amount of weight and she could have gives the names of the plastic.
en_004288	They could of allowed the clamp to hang for 10 minutes. They could of put more weight on the clamp.
en_004289	A) Based on the student's data plastic B was the plastic that stretched the longest in both trials because it went 22mm and plastic A only went 10mm. In trial 2 plastic B went 23mm and plastic D only went 20mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are by telling us how much weight to put in the clamp and having the average of both trials.
en_004290	Plastic type B stretched the most compared to the other plastics while plastic C did not stretch at all. The students could improve the experiment by listing the starting measures of each plastic and performing three trials instead of 2.
en_004291	A conclusion I can make based on the student's poulded data is that plastic type B was able to be stretched the farthest. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results is you should try the experiment at different temperatures ( not stretches the plastic would cold compressed the items of the polymer) and list the weights they used (how heavy they were).
en_004292	a)From this information I come to conclude plastic type B stretched the most out the four types. Plastic type D came next, then C, the A.^p (b)This student could made this lab better in two ways, they could have told us how much weight to put on the plastics, and they could have explained more how to measure it, with inches or milimeters.
en_004293	A) In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability with an average of 22.5 mm stretch, followed by plastic type D, averaging 20 mm, then plastic type C, averaging 13.5 mm, then the plastic with the lowest stretchability was plastic type A, averaging 11 mm of stretch. ^P B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by including that all the plastic types were equally cut and measure. They could have also included to use the same amount of weights for each trial or experiment.
en_004294	In conclusion the graph shown states that plastic (type B) streched the most compared to the rest of the types of plastic. ^P One way the student can improve this experiment would he to use the same weights for each type of plastic. Another way would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial.
en_004295	A)Plastic type D stretched the most .^p They could have done 3 trials instead of two. They could have told you the weight measurement.
en_004296	"Plastic types A, B, C, and D all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial. On the second trial plastic type ""C"" stretched out only 13mm less than trial one. ^p Constant amount of weight. They could have also improved it by more trials."
en_004297	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that the plastic bag B and D are the least desirable bags because they stretched far when the warm and weight were added  plastic bags A and C where the most durable because they eld most stretch as far  when the weights were added. (b) One way the students could have improved the their design is by making all the bags length the same. The student also could have made the weights a specific number so that all the types of plastic had the same amount of weight pulling on it.
en_004298	Based on the data I would say that plastic type B streached the most for both trials.^p The students didn't tell how big the weights were and they didn't have a control test.
en_004299	a.) Based on the student's data,  plastic type B had the most stretchabilty, or was the stretchiest plastic.^p b.) The students could have used a control, for example a non plastic to compare the stretchabilty and to help make a better conclusion and analysts. The students could have used the same amount of weight for each plastic and each trial, so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their data.
en_004300	Plastic B was the strongest out of all four plastics. Two ways that the experiment could have been improved is to have more trials and specific measurements.
en_004301	The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity as the results and mave to decrease the differ as amount stretched an up from T1 to T2.
en_004302	A) I can conclude that plastic A stretched the longest (2mm) and that plastic C did not stretch, but decreased in length from 14mm to 13mm (1mm). ^p B) Students could measure all the plastics aat the once and they could do something else.
en_004303	The table shows that plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastic types. Plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial one and stretched 23mm in trial two. Plastic type D stretch 20mm in both trials, them plastic type C stretched 14mm in trial one and 13mm in trial two and plastic Type A stretched 10mm in trial one and 12mm in trial two. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment design and/on validity of the results are that they could have used the exact same weights everytime and said what types pf plastic they used.
en_004304	a) Plastics will stretch and bend when weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to be changed. ^p b) The students could have listed the types of plastics being used and listed the original length.
en_004305	A. The students data clearly shows that the more you data plastics A and B the longer they get but it is the opposite for C and D, they only get stronger.^p B. The students could have done 3, 4, or even 5 tests something can go wrong in 1 test, multiple tests would have shown more constant results. Lastly, a materials list should have been added to help a person prepare for the experiment.
en_004306	A-A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type B polymers with the most stretchability.^p B-Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would be one, change the hanging time from five minutes to two or three and two, add a third trial to make results more valid.
en_004307	A- My conclusion is that if the student kept on stretching this plastic type it would probably snapon the 3rd time. ^p B- Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by testing a third trial. Another way is the student could have put more weight on the plastic to see how the weight affected the plastic.
en_004308	(A) Plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic of all the bags because it stretched 22mm (Trial 1) & 23 (trial 2) while the other plastics didn't stretch as much. ^p (B) The student could've improved the experimental design by stating how many weights to place on the plastic and how much each weight weighs. Also, they could've stated how much of the plastic should be taped onto the table and how much should hang freely.
en_004309	a) The conclusion drawn from this student's data is that plastic B is the most stretchable because it was the one that remained firm for the longest time.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved his procedure are, he could have specified on how many weights to add to the clamp and how heavy they should be. He could also have specified if each plastic needed to be the same length.
en_004310	(a)Plastic A with amount of stretchness was 10-13, and plastic C stretchness was 14-13 had the lowest stretchness. Plastic B and D with the stretchness around 20-23 were the highest ones with more stretchness. ^p (b) Two ways the students could improved the experimental design or validity of the results is by making more trials and making sure they measured the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to be secure.
en_004311	Add the fist two togahtr and that how I do it?
en_004312	1) Acording to the data, plastic B stretched the most, and with the exeption of D, the second trial tests only differed by 1 or 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) To have improved the experiment, the student could have stretched the plastics longer. The second time on used heavier weights during te second trial.
en_004313	After the experiment was over we concluded that plastic type B has been stretched the furthest from the weights pulling it down. Plastic type D was the second most stretched plastic then after that was plastic type C, and finally plastic type A. ^p The students didn't show how long the plastic was before stretching it. So we didn't know if all bags were the said length to start out. Another improvement could've have been telling exactly how much weight was added to the end of the bags.
en_004314	To end our experiment we calculated our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 was 20 and T2 20. The students could of used less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes.
en_004315	i conclude that plastic B stretched the most. Its T1 was 22 and its T2 was 23 A,C,D their T1 and T2 was lower but D had 20 for T1 and T2. for validity the students could have done the weights for all the plastic together instead of doing it separate, they could have done three trials instead of 2 trials.
en_004316	It appears that plastic type B stretched out the most and plastic type A stretched out the least. One way that the student could have improved their experiment would be to tell what kind of plastic to do. Also the student should have put how big the plastic was in the begining.
en_004317	A.) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is plastic type B has more Strechability than the other ones. ^p Two ways a student could improve the experiment design could be add more trials the minimum is three, and also make sure the plastic are all the same size to begin with. Doing this could also increase the validity of the of the experiment and make it more accurate.
en_004318	They could of added more weight and they could of let it hang for more than 5 min. The con clusion I have based on the student's data is that (T2) was more stretch out than (T1).
en_004319	A conclusion for the graph could be what they did to get to the end of their experiment.^p B. One way the student could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing. Another way is to make sure everything is all right.
en_004320	A. The plastic polymer with the most stretchablity was plastic type B. this is because it stretched 22 and 23mm. B. Two ways the student could told you what type of plastics they were using and how much weight was applied to stretch out the plastics.
en_004321	In the trials the plastic type B stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest. b The students could have improve their experiment by running 1 more trial for validity and a control to compare to.
en_004322	A) For the most part all of the plastics changed in some way except for one type. ^p B) The student could have done the experiment more then just two times, to see how his/her answers might have verifed.
en_004323	a) My conclusion on this experiment is plastic type A is the stronger because it stretched the least.^p b) 2 ways that could of improved the experiment are make the plastic the same size and use the same amount of weights.
en_004324	a. Based on the data, I conclude that plastic type B Stretched the most during both trials. ^p b. Two ways the students could've improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before stretching them. Also, specify what types/size weighs because one person could put on a 1 pound weight and someone else could put on a 2 pound weight and get completely different results.
en_004325	a) Based on the data type B stretched the most in both trials then any others. Type B had more elatistity and type A had the least elastisity. ^p b) This student could improve this experiment by recording the amount it stretched every 2 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in T1 is used in T2.
en_004326	Based on the students data the conclusion will be that plastic B works better than the others in the first trial plastic B had 22 mm and the second trial plastic B had 23 mm.^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design are to repeat the experiment. Another way is to add a control.
en_004327	A) Plastic type B was the stretchest plastic type because in trial 1 it got 22 mm and it trial 2 it got 12 mm. ^p B) The student could have had the plastic types start at the same lengths and could have changed the experiment the which plastic is the most discrible.
en_004328	A) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most, ending up at 22 and 23 mm, respectively.^p B) Two ways the student could've improved the design/validity of the results is including how much weight is put on the clamps, and also including the original size of plastic to begin with.
en_004329	A) The conclusion I have drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most flexibility and plastic A has the least.^p B) Two ways the student could have improved his/her data is by measuring each plastic before he/she stretched it out. The also could have.
en_004330	b)The student could have improved by describing how many weights are used and how much they weighed.
en_004331	I would say that plastic tape B has the most streachability, two ways the student could improve their designs would be to have a specific amount of weight so the expiriment is valid and they could add a third trial to make the expiriment more valid.
en_004332	My conclusion to the experiment is that the best working plastics ar A &B because they stretched out the most the second time. The student could have run another trial and also added more weights to make sure it would really stretch.
en_004333	(A) Overall, plastic type B had stretched the most. Plastic type B just stretched a little further. This means that plastic type B had the most resistence to the weights/clamps and this plastic would be the most durable to use B. One way to improve the design would be to measure all the plastics to the same length so the results come out more accurate. Another way could be to have weights all be the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others.
en_004334	a) The conclusion I drew from this experiment is that plastic D stretched the most. It stretched 20mm while plastic A only stretched 12 mm.^p b) The student could have replaced the samples before the second trial and made all of the sample the same length.
en_004335	A. From the data you can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the furthest. ^p B. The the could have done more experiments and they could tell how much weight so start out with.
en_004336	The students could have averaged the two lengths of each plastic to get only one number for each. They also should have done one more trail to make it reliable.
en_004337	a.) The student's data shows that plastic type B had stretched the most out of the four types of polymer plastics. ^p b.) One way the students could've improved the design and/or validity of the results would be to make a third trial, seeing as some of the results were changed.  Another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use and to make sure to use the same ones.
en_004338	Based on the student's data T2 seems to be able to stretch just a little more compared to T1. Two ways to improve the experiment would be of course more trials and more valiability. The student could get different brands of plastic from grocery stores and test which is more stretchable.
en_004339	-I think that the plastic types is going to be more danger because the student have add clamp to the bottom of the plastic types. not only that but what the student could have done is to make the plastic type hung for more than 5 minutes and they could ha
en_004340	Based on the experiment, plastic type B was the stretchiest because it stretched the most from the weights placed in it. Two ways in which the students could have improved the experiment are specifying the number weights and how much they could weigh. If the students did not use the same amount of weights for each plastic then these plastic are invalid.
en_004341	My conclusion to the students data is that the sample that was used wasn't the correct form of solution, and I think if they added make there experiment would've been successful.
en_004342	a) I conclude that plastic B is more strechable because it has the most (higher) length which is 23 and two trials. ^p The student could have take a longer table and do all the plastic and attached the clamp in all of them while the one before was hanging for 5 mins.
en_004343	Plastic type B stretched longer then all the other plastic types. B T1 was 22 and T2 was 23 is stretched the most weights in 5 minutes. They students could have improved their experiment by doing another trial like T3 and see which plastic type held the most weight.
en_004344	a.The conclusion I drew form the student's data is that the plastic types A stretched out about the same each trial except for plastic type D which stayed the same ^p b. Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design or validized their results is by increasing the # of weights and or time of the trials. Also, another way that could have made their results more valid is by having more than just results more valid.
en_004345	2) I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most amount out of all the other plastics. ^P b) The students could improve the experimental design by adding more trials and adding a control.
en_004346	A) When we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights, the results read that plastic B increased the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p B) One way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics. Another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment.
en_004347	The conclusion I have drawn based on the students data is that plastics B and D are the best polymers because those were the two plastics that had stretched the farthest on both trials. ^p Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to do even more trials. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time.
en_004348	A) From the information of the graph I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most for both trials the amount stretched was the highest. ^p 3b) Ways those students could improve there expirement, is by being more detailed in those procedure. Another way would be to perform more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and compare notes.
en_004349	Plastic B is the strongest with the length of 23. One why the student could improve their results is how much the weights weigh. Another way is how heavy was the clamp.
en_004350	In conclusion based on the student's data, plastic type D had the same amount stretched 20mm. However, Plastic type A had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by writing the types of plastic instead of type A,B,C and D. Another way the students could have improved is by adding a prediction to what they thought was going to happen.
en_004351	According to the chart Trial 1 was more effective than trial 2. The student couldve improven the experimet by using different materials than plastic. Or do at least one more trial. (T3)
en_004352	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable, followed by type D, followed by type C, followed by type C, followed by type A. One way the experiment could be improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of the plastic starts at the same size. Another way to improve is to perform more than 2 trials.
en_004353	a. Plastic type A is the most stretchable and type d is not stretchable at all. ^p b. That student could of done more trials of each plastic type and done a control of each.
en_004354	Based on the data plastic type B can be stretched more than the other plastics.^p 1. They could have said the type of plastic used. 2. They could have added the average stretch.
en_004355	"Based upon the student's information "" by performing this experiment, plastic type B has stretched the most on average by 22.5 millimeters. Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting. The student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type, all of which should have the same amount."
en_004356	a) The conclusion based from the student data would be the more weights added to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to stretch. ^p b) The student could improve the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights weigh. Another improvement would be to do more trials.
en_004357	Based on the data found by the students in the polymer investigation plastic B had the most tensile strength or could stretch the most tensile plastic A had the least tensile strength. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by performing 3 or more trials for validity. Also the student could have included the weight of each weight that was stretching the plastic.
en_004358	a) My conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the farthest and plastic type A is thicker because it didn't stretch as much.^p B) The student should have only did 3 trials and they should have told us what kind of plastic was used for the experiment.
en_004359	3. a) According to the results, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These are ways the student could have made their experiment better.1) Take all plastic samples with the same length. 2) Add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial.
en_004360	In conclusion, the plastics were expirimented and plastic that had the potential to strech most was plastic B which results were 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. The one that least stretched was plastic A with 10mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. All the other plastics results that were tested were in between.
en_004361	It seemed as if the plastic stretched further or stayed the same in these trials. Type A stretched from 10mm to 12mm. Type B 22mm to 23mm. Type C 14mm to 13mm, and type D 20mm to 20mm. ^p B) The student should have been more specific with their table. the student also could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment.
en_004362	a) According to the data it can be inferred that plastic B's polymer plastic stretches the most compared to the other plastics. It can also be concluded that the data is prease due to the closeness of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial.^P b.) The student could improve the experimeat by having the amount of plastic used a constant. This allows the student to have only one independent variable. (The type of plastic). They can also explain that the weights most be the same weight for plastic, so the data is not effected.
en_004363	a) B stretched out the most because it stretched out, a total of 45(mm) A 22, C27 and D 40. B) One way to improve the lab is instead of two trials do three. Find waay is have a control grone.
en_004364	Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by adding materials and also doing the experiment again.
en_004365	A) I can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the most. It stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.^p B) One way this experiment could be improved is by adding more trials. Another way that this experiment could,by improved is by telling or starting how long was each plastic type before stretching it.
en_004366	A. Based off of the data table plastic B had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic A had the least with 10mm estretch.^p B Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to have more trials and also have a control
en_004367	a)Polyme B has the most stretchability, whilepolyme A has the least stretchability.^p (b)The students should have included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples. They also should've recorded the amount of weight they used.
en_004368	Based on the students data I concluded that Plastic type B was most stretchable and A was the least stretchy. To improve the validity at this experiment they could have included the starting length, how much the weights weighed ad also could of condicted a third or more trials.
en_004369	The student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights.
en_004370	a) One conclusion that I determined according to the data was that plastic type B stretched the most overall in both trial 1 and 2. Another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type D, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. ^p b) One way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag.
en_004371	Based on the students data the polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently. To better the experiment the lab needs to include the stretching measurement so there can be data to compare before & after. Another thing would to for all plastics is store on the same length. This data is neccary to make just numbers on a graph to data.
en_004372	In T1 and T2 B stretched out the most durring the 5 minutes.^p The student could improve his experiment by doing an extra trial for a more valid result. As well the student could have stated in the experimental design the weights heavieness.
en_004373	A) Based on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type B stretched out the most compared to all the other plastic types in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials which would of made the experiment more accurate another way would be specifying how much the weight and clamp actually weighed.
en_004374	A) Plastic type B 's polymer has the most stretchability as shown in both trials and the polymer type in B is similar to the polymer in D due to the fact that their results are closest. Polymer in A is not very strecher nor is the one in C. ^P B) Ways to improve both the design and validity include using something strongest than tape to hold up the plastic and weight, also using a timer to improve valibility.
en_004375	A) According to the results of the students plastic B was stretched out the most. For plastic A the results are 10 mm for T1 and 12 mm for T2. For plastic B the results are 22 mm for T1 and 23 for T2. Plastic C the results are 14 mm for T1 and 13 mm for T2. Lastly for plastic D the results are 20 mm for T1 and 20 mm for T2. B) One way the students could have improved their experiment was they could have done more trials with the different types of plastic. Another way they could have improved was to show how many weights they used and what kind of plastic they used so we could see the effect they had according to the type.
en_004376	a. The student bottles have stretched more during was first atempt and plastic B was stretched the most during both.^p b. The student could have improved his experiment by using 2 bottles to tape and not dorpping the other two bottles.
en_004377	two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could of did a little more and took there time to make things good and do there best.
en_004378	Upon the completion of the experiment, it was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic B stretched on aver age 22 mm, while Plastic A stretched an average 11mm, plastic C stretched an average 13.5 mm, and plastic D stretched an average 20mm. Two ways that the group could have improved their experiment would be to include how big the clamp is and to include how much weight is being added to the clamp.
en_004379	Based on the students data i have come to the conclusion that plastic D is the most reliable polymer because it stretches the most. By giving the measurement of plastic used for each trial the student could have improved the experiment design. Also, by writing the amount of weights they use, the students could have improved his experiment design.
en_004380	A) Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design would be to state how much weight to add to the clamp, and to do 3 trials with an average instead of just two with no average.
en_004381	A.) Plastic a and b stretched more from trail one to to trail 2. (Plastic C went down one and D stayed the same. B.) Two ways the students could have, improve the experimental design or validity of the results is they could have have done another trail for each plastic. Also they could have made sure all of the plastic were the same length to start off with.
en_004382	Based on the students trials, plastic type B was the best one because it allowed the most stretching. In its first test it scored the highest of 22mm, and then in test 2 scored 23 mm, also the highest. Plastic type B will stretch the most if weights was put on it and for 5 minutes. 6P (A) The student could have improved this lab by adding specific measurements to certain steps such as how much weight should be added in step 4. (B) The student could have also improved rethis lab by making each plastic the same length. In step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate.
en_004383	Plastic type A stretched longer the second that, so did plastic type B. Plastic type D stretched the same both trials. The student could of named the types of plastic or test it more than two times.
en_004384	A) The stretchability for the four different types of polymer plastics. The calculations for trial one and trial two we almost the same. For example plastic type A on trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it was 12 then on plastic type D for both trials it was 20. ^p The two ways they could have improved it was by putting weights in and making it heavier and the other one is you can also bring the plastic bags apart trying to rip them.
en_004385	The conclusion in this experiment is that plastic type B is the most stretchability. When the students added the weight to the plastic and it stretched out to do the longest in both trials. Trial 1 it was 22mm and in trial 2 it was 23mm. 2 was that the students would of improved this experiment is to perform more trials to receive the most accurate answer, and they could of had control and see how the plastics stretch with no weight on them.
en_004386	Based on the students data, Plastic Type B stretched the most. In the first trial it stretched 22 mm and in the second trail it stretched 23 mm. The second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm. The student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. Also, he/she could have stated how much weight they were using to stretch the material.
en_004387	Based on the data I can conclude they plastic B and D are the most flexible, to improve the experiment students could have cut all the samples to the same length and they could have preformed more trials.
en_004388	"A)Plastic type B had the best stretchability while A had the worst. Type B stretched an average of 7.3 units longer in T1 And 8 units in T3.^p (B)In their procedure they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that they used. they could've specified the amount of weight they were using in step #4."
en_004389	According to this student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchable of the types tried. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the data keeps accurately valid. The experiment design was poor. One way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, are the tight, etc. Another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials.
en_004390	The data that the student got is corrupted. The reason I say this is because he/she should have wrote on the data table the starting measure of each bag. He/she could have also used the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results. Another way that the student could have improved would be doing another trial to make that the results are accurate.
en_004391	In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.
en_004392	a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid.
en_004393	A) According to the data table testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics, plastic B is the stretchiest because it stretched 22-23mm. The other types of plastics didn't stretch this much. ^P B) One way this experimental design could be improved is to say the 4 different kinds of plastics used. Another way this can be improved is to tell us how much weight to add to the clamp when stretching the plastic.
en_004394	To inquire hi experiment be could of said how much weight he added the the plastic bags. Each one was to have the same amount of weight. Second he should or had same type of measure ment on how long the bags where befor he did the experiment, then show how long they got.
en_004395	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic is worked the best for both trials with 22 mm for that I and 23mm for trial 2. Plastic D not 20mm for both trials. Plastic C with 14mm and 13mm and the least stretchy was plastic A with 10mm and 12mm. B) Two ways they could have improved was to name the polymers such as BP. They also could have said how much the clamps and the weights weighed.
en_004396	a) Polymers C appears to have the greatest amount of streach ability. ^p b) The student could have added a control and performed more trials.
en_004397	(A) The student found the two stretched plastics to be B and D. They both have over 20 mm in both trials and performed much better than the two other trials. ^p (B) The student could have improved his procedure of experiment by giving a hypothesis of just which plastic they thought would be the stretchiest. After that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn't.
en_004398	a) A  conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type A would be the stretchiest plastic because it stretched the most at two mm, while type B and C stretched one mm, and type D didn't stretch at all.^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to record the measure of plastic before stretching on the data table, and also to add more trials.
en_004399	Plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p The student should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before preforming the experiment. If all the plastics are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the length or because of the type of plastic. He or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity.
en_004400	(a) Plastic B stretched the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic D being the second longest and A having the shortest amount stretched. ^p (B)  The student could have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just 5 minutes and they could of had a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second time round.
en_004401	Based on the students data there really wasnt any difference in the animals stretched. The students could have put more weights on they even could have extends the time hanging to improve the experiment design and / or validing of the results.
en_004402	A conclusion can be that plastic types B and D are more strecthable than plastic types A and C. One way they could have improved is by adding the plastics' original length in the graph to help show that they did strecth. Another way is to have include the weight of the weights so that it can be duplicated if needed.
en_004403	A. Plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C stretch 1mm and plastic D didn't stretch. ^p B. The student could have done this over distinct results . The student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower.
en_004404	a. As you can see, plastic B could stretch longer than any plastic. Plastic D had similar results for both trials. Plastic A was the only plastic that was able to not stretch that far.^p b. What this student should do to improve his experiment is to run more trials and to add what he is comparing to.
en_004405	Based on the information provided from the experiment, I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability (22mm, 23m) and plastic A is the least stretchability (10mm, 12mm). Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their lab was to cut the same length of each plastic prior to testing stretchability and to specify the amount and mass at the weights to added.
en_004406	My conclusion is that the plastic that can stretch more is plastic B because it has the longest accounted stretched in mm, and other plastics do not stretch longer than plastic B.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by putting one set of weights in T1 and another st of weights in T2. Also they could have improved by letting it hang for more time to see if they can resist.
en_004407	a) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most flexible and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initially be. This will improve validity as well.
en_004408	My conclusion is that the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had a huge difference, but type B and D are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now A and C are closer one is 12 the other 13. And type D stayed the same during both trials. Plus a way to improve this experiment would be have more trials because there wasn't that many data to compare and the ones they had wasn't relly of a difference.
en_004409	a) Based on the students data plastic type B streched the most out of any other type of plastic. b) To improve the experiment the students could have increased the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. To improve the validity of the results the students should have included the plastics orginal length in the table.
en_004410	a) As you guys can see the sample of plastic B was the most strechable plastic out of all of them, the plastic B streched the most in both trials.^p b) 1 ways that the student could of changed the experiment by labeling the plastics that he used. 2 He also could of changed the weight of the clamp.3) He could of also added another try to make sure that witch is the most strechable plastic.
en_004411	Based upon the data plastic type B, stretches the most. The student could have had a designated amount of weight for adding to the clamps. The student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, things go along more smoothly.
en_004412	A) a conclusion of this experiment is type B stretched the most, it Stretched an average of 22.5mm, this was greater then type D with an Average of 20mmtpe C with 13.5mm and lastly A with 11mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment design/validity is specify if the same amount of weight is being added and have 3trials to make sure numbers are accurate.
en_004413	Plastic type B held 22mm on the first trial and 23mm on the second trial. So plastic type B held the most mm in both trials. The only plastic close to it was plastic type D which had 20mm in trail 1 and 20mm in trial 2. Since plastic type B held B held more in both trials, then plastic type B is the can hold the most. The way the students could have improved their experiment is by having more trials. This would have improved the validity of their results. Another way is by making it longer than 5 minutes to let the plastics hang, because it might leave longer stretch much.
en_004414	A) It seems like plastic B has the most stretch ability because it stretched 22 mm in T1 and 23 T2. ^p B) To improve the experimental assign the students could have kept the amount of weight they carried to the bag constant and they could have kept the weights for another five minutes and measured it again afterwards.
en_004415	In the second trail two plastics, A and B, stretched out more unlike 2 and B, C stretched less the second time while D stayed the same. One way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing it a third time to see which of the highest two were right. A second would be showing the length of the plastics when the student first started.
en_004416	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the strongest because T1 only stretched 10mm and T2 only stretched 12mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by naming the types of plastics that a used and by adding a control to the experimental design.
en_004417	A) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that A was the weakest and C was the most ourable are ^p B) one wagt that it can be improved is to explain how C was unstretched. Another way for improvement was have more trials to see what happens to each of the plastics.
en_004418	A) My conclusion for this experiment is that Trial 2 is going to get the most stretchability  for the plastic type. ^p B) The plastic sample doesn't have to hang freely down the side of a table and before  you perform the second trial just like the first, add on additional 5-10 minutes to the procedure.
en_004419	In this expierement we have learned that all bags tend to stretch when carrying weights. In this expierement, plastic type A proved to be the least stretchiest while plastic type  proved to be stretched the most. ^P The students could have said how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be. ^P The students could have also said what type of plastics they used so we can test it our selves.
en_004420	Based on the students data the conclusion that plastic B has the most stretchability because it has the highest length in millimeters after the experiment. Two things the students could have done to improve the experimental design and validity of the results would be holding the variables more controll. For example set the length of each plastic next if they had a set amount of weight, the results would have come out more valid.
en_004421	The students had 4 types of plastic A, B, C, D. They wanted to see which one would stretch the most. They held 2 trials and B came out to be the stretches ist out of them all with a 22, 23 mm
en_004422	Based off of the data, plastic type D had the longest stretchability while plastic type A had the least. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be better perform more trials, or make sure that the weight applied to each plastic was the same.
en_004423	A - In the second trial plastic type A and B both had more mm but plastic type C in the first trial there was more and with plastic type D it was the same  for both trials.B-They could repeat trials, and use more different type of plastics.
en_004424	a.) The order of plastics, from most to least stretchy, is B, D, C then A, where A is the stretchiest and B the least. The overall stretchings of the plastics remained mostly the same from T2 to T2. ^p b.) Taping the plastic a specific distance in from the table edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to each plastic would improve the validity, especially when working with such small length chances.
en_004425	a) Based on the students data the plastic don't stretches a lot much type 1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference.^p b)
en_004426	A) Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh (4). Another way is to set a specific length pf plastic, not just any measure the length (1).
en_004427	A. Based on the resluts, plastic type b was the best with the longest (mm) stretched in both trials, 22,23. Then type d with 20mm in both trials then c with 14mm, 13mm. Finally type A with 10mm, 12mm. ^p B. Two ways that the students could improve their validity are 1. do more trials and 2. use more types of plastics.
en_004428	a.) Based on the students data from this experiment, plastic type B had the greatest stretchability out of all four plastics. ^p To be more accurate with the validity of their results would be to make sure the length of all the samples in both trials were equal for all types. Another way to improve i he experiment would be to increase the weights in the second trial by  doubling them, and then sampling the data from the two trials.
en_004429	a) Plastic B can stretch the longest where as Plastic A can not stretch as far. ^p  b) One way to improve the experiment would be to specify a specific number and type of weights that are being added and to keep it constant. Also, another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors, and more trials would lead to more accurate data.
en_004430	Based on the experiment, the best plastic based on stretchability would be plastic B. It stretched 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of all the plastics. Plastic D would also be good, stretching 20 mm, plastic A and C were not so good stretching 10, 12 and it 13 respectively. One way the students could improve their experiment is to add a third trial (B). This would allow for better results because its experiment is being done 3 trials and an average could be made. Another improvement would be to add different weights to see how far each plastic will stretch.
en_004431	1) The most stretchable plastic with the most tensile strength, is plastic D, because during both trials it stretched further than all the other plastics.^p 2) a) They could have formulated a hypothesis so that their experiment would have become more guided.b)They could have made sure that each plastic (before stretching) was the same length.
en_004432	A) Based on the students data, my conclusion to this is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, because for both trials, the mm of the length was still the same. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch.
en_004433	a) This experiment on polymers turned out to work perfectly without any weird results. For example in this experiment plastic/ polymer B performed the best because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. While on the other hand plastic /polymer A experiment the worst because in trial one it only stretched about 4mm and in trial two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm. ^p B)Two ways that those students could have improved this experiment is  by naming the plastic in which they tested and also they should have measured how heavy the weights are to get a more set on judgement , more trials, more attempts & more accurate results.
en_004434	Based on the data plastic A had the most significant growth in Amount streched with streching 2 mm faster than it's original trial therefore this polymer has the most streachability. ^p The student could of had an control, also same amount of weights, and did more trials.
en_004435	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that the amount of tape they put on the plastic was equal and how far they taped the plastic on the table.
en_004436	The student could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results. They could have done so, by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Having the plasics at different lengths hanging from the table will cause error. Also she could say how heavy of weights will be hanging, and for how long. All of these factors affected the experiment.
en_004437	This experiment concluded that plastic type A is the least stretchable land plastic type B the most stretchable. Plastic C is also not that stretchable and D is stretchable. One way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the weights are the same weight. Also that the original plastics are all the same length.
en_004438	My conclusion is that plastic type B was the plastic that streched the most. Also in trial two (T2) all the plastic streched more except for plastic type C. The student could have improved by making his hypothesis clearer. He also could of given us the names of the plastics.
en_004439	Plastic type B was stretched out the most. The students could have improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. They also could have put down the length of the plastic befor they started streching.
en_004440	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all the polymer plastic. The students could have improved the experiment by testing more specific in their procedure. The length of the tapes should be the same for all the plastics as it was not mentioned. The weight of the weights was not given as it does affect the result in the amount stretched. The student could have also mentioned the name of the polymers to make the data table more specific and the experiment more useful to others.
en_004441	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest . Even though A C and D did not have very different results, B stretched the most. Also plastic D remained constant both trials. ^p B) One way the student could have improved was to make more trials. Two trials can not give the best results. Also, they could have lengthened the time and put heavier weights on the clamps.
en_004442	A) The results that were given showed that type A was the least stretchiest type C had the second least stretch, type D was the second stretchiest and finally type D could stretch the most. ^p The student could have improved this experiment is by showing how long they stretched the plastic till it broke, and add a control to the experiment so they could compare the results to a regular stretched plastic.
en_004443	A) The conclusion of this experiment is that polymer B has the most stretchability, while polymer A is the least stretchable. ^p B) The students could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials to confirm the data.
en_004444	a) Plastic B has the greakest amant of stretchability, surpassing the next stretchiest by 2-3 mm. ^p b) The students, in order to improve validity, must record the length of each sample prior to stretching, to observe change. Also, they should acknowledge the amount of weight used to stretch the plastics, and never change it.
en_004445	"a) The conclusion I'd draw from the student's data would be that plastic type ""B"" was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve his experimental design, the student could've specified how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know. To improve his results validity, he could have done more than 2 trials-the more trials he did, the more valid his results would be."
en_004446	(a) Plastic type A stretched the least and is therefore the most durable of the 4 types. ^p (b) The students could improve the experimental design by determining a consistent starting area for all of plastics, and they could improve the validity by doing more trials.
en_004447	This student's data proves that plastic D had the greatest stretchability. stretching, 20 mm after 5 minutes. The least stretchable type of plastic was plastic A which only stretched 10mm in the first trial and 12 mm in the second. A way the student could have improved the experiment is they should have used a more firm material than tape such as stables or tieing it. Another way to improve is to allow the trials to each stand for 10 minutes to receive greater results.
en_004448	My conclusion to this polymer investigate is that plastics type B has the most stretchability. I think this because trial 1 and trials 2 both have the most stretchability. Some ways that the experiment could have been improved is by taking the I cader how much. The weights and clamp weighed. Another way the the experiment could he improved is by telling the reader where the clamp was placed.
en_004449	a) Plastic B was the stretched of all the polymeres. Plastic A was the strongest of all the polymers. ^P b) This person should have the exact length of the plastic. He/she also should have told the exact amount of weight to add to the clamp.
en_004450	To my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than the first time because it was already stretened from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened. two ways to improve the experiment is time it longer to see the difference and use a different piece of plaste for each trial.
en_004451	In conclusion plastic type B stretched out the longest in both trials and most of the others were far behind it. Two ways I would improve the design is to say how much weight I am adding at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom to even out the weight so it didn't rip through the middle.
en_004452	A) All plastics stretched but D making D the most durable plastic. ^p B). Add more trials which would improve the data. ^p Instead of the weights being on for 5 minutes having them on for 10 would show long term effect. ^p use the same clamp for for all plastics.
en_004453	They could have used beacher holder and tape the plastic to the beaker holder and let it hold freely.They could get more results for different trials.
en_004454	The data shaved that plastic A stretched the most compared to the other plastics. Plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C decreased 1mm in trial 2 and plastic D stayed the same. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results is to include the starting length of each plastic in the results to better understand how much each plastic stretched. Secondly for trial 2 I think the student should have added more weights and added a trial 3 with more weights for more results.
en_004455	Based on the student's data I can see that plastic type B had the Most stretchability because both trials it stretched the most. To make this more valid, the student should have used the same length to start with for each plastic. Also they should include how many weights should be added and have much each weight weighs in order to keep it constant.
en_004456	A) Plastic type B will Sstrech the most, while plastic A will strech the least. B) describe the initial lenht of each plastic, and describe the amount of weight added to the clamp.
en_004457	A conclusion that can be drawn from their data is that plastic type B has the most elastic compared to A,C, and D. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment and made it more valid would be to do another trial and let us know where each of the plastics start lengths were.
en_004458	Plastic A and B stretched, cup C Di stretched whe mm and plastic D stayed the same. This experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer.
en_004459	3.a) They found that plastic type B has the exact stretchability because it stretched more than any of the other polymers. ^p b) The could improve the validity of the experiment by doing more trials. They could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment.
en_004460	a) Plastic B stretched the most at av average at 22.5 mm plastic A only stretched an average of 11mm, which is the least out of all of the plastics tested. b)  One way the students could have improved their experiment would be to say how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp. Another thing they should have done would be to beep all of the plastics taped to a table at the same height. It does not say they are all held at the same height in the procedure, so we cannot assume they were.
en_004461	Base on the student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, and type A doesn't stretch as far. ^P 2 ways the students could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results. Another way would be have the same amount of weights for each type.
en_004462	a) A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is that the plastic A stretched less in each trial from any other plastic T. it was 10 and T2  it was 12mm. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by first telling us how many weights C how heavy they should be. The second way is by doing more trials.
en_004463	In conclusion, each one of the plastics are different types of plastic due to the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic is different due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more test trials to see if the data is perfectly correct and by making sure the amount of weights added on the claps were equal.
en_004464	The examples came out pretty accurate to the chart and procedure. ^p But they needed to improve possibly by doing longer trials or adding how much weight if someone gave me this procedure I would not be able to perform it.
en_004465	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that the plastic that  can be stretched the most is type B, and the one which can be stretched the least is type A. The students could have improved this design by keeping or consistent sample size. Another way this experiment could have been more valid as if the weights on the plastic were also kept consistent.
en_004466	A) Based on the data we found is that plastic B was the plastic that had stretched the most and plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the student could have improved there experimental design is to be more exact on the amount of weight used, Alsocould of shortend the time.
en_004467	As a result of our testing type b stretched the most out of all the other plastic type. ^p One way the stretches could have improved there testing could be to.
en_004468	(A) A conclusion cannot be made with the amount of data given, the experiment doesn't show the starting size of each plastic same so the data given doesn't show how much each some stretched. (B) To improve this experiment the students must record, and keep constant the size of each plastic sample. Another way to improve the validity of this experiment is to record, and keep constant the amount of weight added to each of the plastic samples.
en_004469	a) As you can see in my table that plastic B was the most stretched plastic and the none least stretched was plastic A.^p B) I think the students could of told how much each weight really whey. Another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much space was the weight and plastic from each other.
en_004470	One way they could of improved this experiment.
en_004471	My conclusion is in the second trial (T2). Each plastic sample stretched longer than it did in the first trial (T1). Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is they should have told us how each longnt pound's did the nitach anlo the clamps instead of taking one sample of plastic take 3 or 4 samples.
en_004472	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic A and B are both equally stretchy. They both increased by one mm long. I can also conclude that plastic D is not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm. One way the student could have improved the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length at the beggining so the results are more valid and clear. They also could have been specific about how much weight to be added. Another thing they could add is a controll
en_004473	The conclusion of this evestigation is that the plastic types did not stretch much. Type D didn't even phase B. The kould have told us what kind of plastic did they use. And what are you using to measure the plastic types?
en_004474	a)According to the data, plastic type D is the strongest because it stretched 20 mm in both trials. Therefore, it has the greatest stretchability.^p (b)The experiment could have been improved by ensuring that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weights. It would also be a good idea to use a control, without the use of weights. This way, it would be easier to improve the end results with the control and variable.
en_004475	The polymer plastics all had different results after each trial was tested. Plastic type A and B both had an increase in length after trial 2. Plastic type C had a negative effect by going down a mm, and D stayed the same. The student could have used different time periods, or even tested the durability of the plastic after it was tested.
en_004476	Plastic type B stretched the farthest.^p The student could have improved the experimental design by recording the exact weight to clamp. They also could have put the measurements of the plastic before it was stretched.
en_004477	The conclusion I can draw from the data is plastic B is the most stretchabety. The data show in trial one it stretched to 22mm and trial two it stretched 23mm while D only stretched 20mm. ^p Two way the student could improve the experiment is do more trial and tell us how much weights to put on.
en_004478	The student got different results. He got A-B lower higher and C-D higher lower. ^p Two ways he could have improved his experimental design was by doing it over.
en_004479	None of the plastic really seemed to move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much.
en_004480	a.) I conclude that plastic type B has the most ability to stretch because it stretched the most in both of the trials. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved on the experiment design and validity and to use a control and add more trials.
en_004481	A. The most stretchable plastic would be plastic type B. ^P B. First off the students have to make sure the plastics are all the same length to begin with. Second their data table should've shown what they started out with.
en_004482	a) Plastic type B stretched the most then type D, then type c, and type A streched the least. ^p b) One way they could have improved would be making the weight constant. The results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time.
en_004483	Plastic type B stretched the most and type A stretched the least. I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchy. Because of the lack of information it is hard to to conclude anything. Two ways they could have improved would be to specify how long each plastic start, as and what your measuring, how much it stretched or how long it is total after being stretched.
en_004484	In conclusion all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type D that stoped the same length. They would of told the types of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also, give before descriptions on procedures.
en_004485	Plastic type 'A' and 'B' stretched more in the second trial as compared to 'C' which decreased by 1mm and 'D' which stayed the same. ^p (B) Maybe to show some difference the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times.
en_004486	I think the student the student should draw a conclusion based on the data he/she has.
en_004487	Plastic type D stretched the furthest and plastic type A stretched the lowest. The student could've listed the diffrent types  of plastics used and explain the procedure better.
en_004488	A) The plastic type D has the most resistance out of the group and type A has the least amount. ^p B) The student should've measured before stretching is to make, control. Then the students should've done the least one more trial.
en_004489	(A) Plastic type B stretched longer than type A, C, and D plastics. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to add make we4ight to the second trial and have tie plastic hang longer.
en_004490	From the students data, you can conclude that plastic type A the most stretchable. You can conclude this because all other types had either1 mm length change, or no change but type A had a change of 2 mm . Two ways the student could have improved would  have been to have more trials for each type to make sure findings were acurate, and to say the amount of weight added onto the plastic samples in his procedure.
en_004491	The conclusion that I drew was that plastic type B stretched the furthest, Two ways that the students could of improve there experiment is that they could of did the experiment a third time, or probaly let the weights hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes.
