Finally, I would need to know if the samples were sitting and drying in the sun or indoors in a climate controlled environment.
fr_010005	1. you would need a scale to weigh the mass before and after 2. you would need a container and a label for each sample 3. you would need a piece of each sample of material
fr_010006	To carry out the procedure, we need to make sure that the containers are clean, use a balance with precision to better diagnose the evolution of the weight of the substances and increase the time during which the samples are left to rest in step _5 because some substances can change its weight.

fr_010012	1) Vinegar can damage the marble. When vinegar meets limestone in marble, a chemical reaction occurs. ... As the vinegar reacts with the marble chips, its low pH is raised to a higher number and less acidic. As a result of the chemical reaction, bubbles or foam are formed. 2.  Vinegar, an acid, dissolves pieces of a material called calcium carbonate in the limestone. This releases carbon dioxide, a gas that rises to the surface as a stream of bubbles. Rocks that do not contain calcium carbonate will not fizz. 3.Once the vinegar and milk were mixed, the reaction occurred and the protein was denatured. ... The vinegar and milk react to form curds (a solid) and whey (a liquid). These curds cannot be returned to the vinegar and milk. Once the curds are completely dry, they form a usable plastic.

fr_010148	Do not use vinegar, Windex or bleach on marble. One use of these acidic substances will eat away at the surface of a marble countertop and dull the stone. Also, do not use abrasive cleaners or pads, as marble can be scratched.  For example, vinegar combined with limestone creates a chemical reaction. When acids and bases combine, they produce water and salts. Putting the limestone in the vinegar starts the chemical reaction. As the acid begins to dissolve the calcium carbonate, we can see the release of carbon dioxide bubbles that fizz upward.  The first thing about vinegar is that you never store it in plastic! The acidic content of the vinegar will eat away at the plastic and there will be micro particles of plastic in your acv, which you drink on an empty stomach! Wow!

fr_010180	The purpose of the experiment should be explained, for example: To determine the mass of four different material samples before and after being exposed to vinegar. The samples should be weighed initially and their weight noted. After the procedure is performed, a report with the conclusion should be made.
fr_010181	- Indicate how to measure the mass of the samples; -Indicate how the data obtained should be recorded.
fr_010182	The last step would be to calculate the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass. This is how we determine how much weight each material has lost. To be fair, the starting mass should have been the same for all materials.
fr_010183	Determine what the objects are, see how porous the objects are, and also weigh the vinegar.

fr_010192	You must make sure to use a precision balance and you must always zero it before using it, you must pick up the materials with a clean hand so as not to alter the result of the experiment, in addition to being careful when handling with the reagents.
fr_010193	First, you should make sure that you have a control sample. Second, you will need to determine the weight before drying. Third, compare the weight before and after drying to see if evaporation correlated with the difference in mass.
fr_010194	Tare the balance before placing the samples in the container. Allow the containers to stand at room temperature.
fr_010195	The mass of the vinegar that was poured into each container should be determined, The mass of the samples after being removed from the container should be weighed, The mass of the samples after immediate rinsing with distilled water should be determined

fr_010265	An accurate and properly calibrated scale is needed to have reliable results. It is also necessary to have a dry final sample before weighing to ensure that the sample does not contain any more liquid, thus distorting the mass measurement. In step three it would have been useful to specify that the containers in question are in fact the containers previously prepared with vinegar. Finally, a list of the equipment needed for the experiment would be useful (precision balance, type of container, tongs, etc.) as well as the substances (what type of vinegar) and materials used.
