fr_020001	a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1). b) Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.
fr_020002	a. type D plastic has better stiffness b._1 take 3 measurements in 1 test and take the average b.2 plastic samples must be of equal thickness
fr_020003	The student has been outperformed.
fr_020004	Plastic B seems to be the most sensitive to stretching. I probably would have offered more precision on the type of weight used.
fr_020005	A. the results before and after the experiments are very close. this means that the plastic tends to keep its size, but in the case where it got smaller, the temperature could have played a role, or even the measuring system b. make sure the temperature and the measuring system are taken into account
fr_020006	the experiment is very good and the students make it better.
fr_020007	a.The four polymer plastics tested underwent permanent deformation after stretching.b. To improve the test, the samples must be of identical dimensions and the weights must be the same for each sample.
fr_020008	Plastics A, B and D are found to have good stretch, plastic C begins to lose its stretch. The student could continue by adding other weights or trying to pull the plastics over a given distance.
fr_020009	a. It is concluded that the samples with plastic types A and B increased on average by _1.5 mm. The sample with type C decreased by 1 mm and the sample with type D showed no change in its initial length. b. to obtain greater validity of the research, the student could choose samples with the same initial length to compare the samples with the types of plastics. Another way to improve the study, the student could repeat the experiment 3 times to find the average of the results for each type of plastic analyzed.
fr_020010	1.Take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length.  2.Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely over the side of the table.  Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.  Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.  5.Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.
fr_020011	Plastics and rubber are made of polymers consisting of smaller units called monomers, which bond (polymerize) into long chains. At present, the vast majority of monomers are produced from petroleum (crude oil/mineral oil) and are therefore non-renewable. Monomers can also be made from biomass, but usually at a higher cost. Apart from monomers, various additives are added to the manufacturing process of plastics and rubber. Additives are chemicals that are necessary for the polymerization process itself, or give the final product its desired specific properties, e.g. plasticizers, flame retardants, thermal and UV stabilizers, biocides, pigments, thinners, etc. Polymers are large in size, which means that they do not penetrate biological membranes and are not particularly reactive and therefore are not considered toxic. On the contrary, unreacted monomers, solvents, additives or degradation products can leak and be exposed to both humans and the environment throughout the life cycle of a product. Many common additives are classified as hazardous according to the EU Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP)_1 . It is relatively unknown for the majority of these chemicals how they affect our health and the environment, but some phthalates, bisphenol A, certain brominated flame retardants and polyfluorinated chemicals, have been relatively well studied and are therefore the focus of this report. These chemicals have a negative impact on humans and the environment, and surveys have shown that a large proportion of the population is constantly exposed to them. When chemicals are released from products or building materials in a home, the dust functions as a chemical sink that reflects any chemicals that may be exposed to the home. The polluted dust will be inhaled or eaten, as it ends up on food, accumulates in the mucous membranes of the mouth, or when children put dusty fingers and objects in their mouths.
fr_020012	a student conducted the following _1 survey to test
fr_020013	A: Plastics A and B are the most flexible. Plastic D is the least flexible. In general, the length of the plastics can be extended with weights.   B: The student could have repeated the experiment a third time.  The student could have used different weights with the same plastic.
fr_020014	The purpose of this practice is to demonstrate how processing and how performing a mechanical test in a thermoplastic polymer can affect the test results and fundamental characteristics such as modulus of elasticity, ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break
fr_020015	The student data provides the test result of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer
fr_020016	My conclusion is that type A stretched the most. The test could be improved by specifying the exact weight of the weights. It is also important to know exactly how much glue was used. The length of the plastic glued to the table should also be the same.
fr_020017	A.THIS IS ALMOST CORRECT B. PRACTICE YOURSELF
fr_020018	a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1).b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020019	we can use a glass plate for an alternative plastic solution.. because the temperature of the plastic can affect the nature of the experiment
fr_020020	measure the weight of the hooks to ensure that the same pressure is applied to all materials
fr_020021	This experiment tested the weights of different types of plastic. The experimental design and validity of the results are valid and robust.
fr_020022	The plastic length is large
fr_020023	a) Different materials will stretch by greater or lesser amounts with a force applied to them. b) The student could have used more accurate tools; The student could have ensured that the conditions at the time were the same as the experiment was run without weather factors.
fr_020024	Type A plastic is the most stretched. The experiment could be improved by testing multiple strips of the same plastic.
fr_020025	Perform a _3rd test, use decimals for measurement, use different weights, let it hang for a longer period of time
fr_020026	The plastic samples stretched because of the weights attached to them.
fr_020027	one. Plastic D seemed to be the most stable b. He could use other types of plastic and also collect more data from the experiment for further analysis
fr_020028	The student was successful
fr_020029	Here is a conclusion: Plastic D did not change in length after the second trial.  The student could have improved the experimental design by doing a third trial to validate their results.  Also, the student could have hung the plastic with the clamp for six minutes or more.
fr_020030	a. From the first and second rows of data, it appears that the lengths increased. However, the last two rows of data appear to be wrong. The lengths of the T_2 experiments must be greater than those of the T1 experiments. b. One is that the student can attach weight to both sides using a pulley. To validate the results, the student can experiment with different initial lengths and show an elasticity constant.
fr_020031	a. Obviously, it wasn't exactly the same both times because there are different results. b. They should have taken more measurements to make sure the experiment was exactly the same as the first time. Maybe film it?
fr_020032	a.Take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length.Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.b.Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.Remove the weights and the clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.
fr_020033	The plastic is lengthened because of the weights. In the second test, the elongation was mostly higher because of the fatigue of the material. The student can use different weights and record the elongations. The student can use different lengths of plastic and record the elongations.
fr_020034	right,the student studies very well and gets more grades.
fr_020035	a. The first test produced greater length differences when adding clips to the plastic during. b.A comparison chart would have been helpful of the before/after results and the two different studies.
fr_020036	Plastic B is the most stretchable. He should have stated if he used the same weight for each sample as well as the mass of the weight used.
fr_020037	a. the plastic hardly stretches at all. b. the student could have pulled the plastic himself. the student could have used a machine.
fr_020038	we can use a glass plate instead of plastic its makes the result chane..this may be correct
fr_020039	T_1 - D 20 This was the correct answer so it was useful to this question
fr_020040	a. Type D plastic maintained an elasticity pattern. b. the student should time the time between the two tests. the student should measure the length of the plastic after the rest period to see if there was any recovery of the material
fr_020041	Plastic B and D elongate the most. To add more control, I would measure its width and depth and weight.
fr_020042	The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers that was tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer
fr_020043	Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1).
fr_020044	a - Basically, the student noticed that different types of plastics have different types of elasticity. b - If I were the student, I would test the plastics without the weight and notice the true deformation it would cause.
fr_020045	a. Plastics B and D stretch more than plastics A and C. b. Do the experiments several times (at least in triplicate) or record the data of the initial length of the plastics and the weight that was placed on each (since it is not specified if they were the same).
fr_020046	a. Type A and B polymer plastics are more stretched than the other two types. Polymer plastics type C are not stretched but shrink from that length. Type D polymer plastics are not stretched. b. _1.The plastic is hammered with a device. This test will tell how tough the plastic is. Higher toughness means harder to break. 2.the plastic is bent back and forth until it breaks. The higher the number of cycles, the better the property of the plastic.
fr_020047	Here are the two ways that can be used more effectively to complete the experiment: - The student could have used any pulling tool to stretch the plastic for a specific period of time or The student could have used hooks on both sides of the plastic to stretch it for a specific period of time.
fr_020048	It seems that T_2 was done more accurately than T1, in fact in my experience it happens to make mistakes on a first test. I don't have any advice to give as I am not a very good scientist unfortunately.
fr_020049	a.The plastic will increase in length when we attach both sides and put weight on it.    B.Based on the experiment, we can say that the plastic will increase. From the data collected by the students, we can tell how much the plastic increases in length.
fr_020050	The second test had more results than the first test. The student could repeat the procedure a third time for the plastic and then see their results.
fr_020051	a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1) ,b) Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.
fr_020052	a)Perform a second trial (T_2) exactly as the first trial (T1),b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020053	The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers which has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer
fr_020054	Plastic A showed a large difference between T_1 and T2, showing that more experiments are needed to determine a more accurate measurement and error. The other plastics showed more accurate measurements, where plastic B was found to be the plastic that deformed the most in the experiment.  To improve the experiment, the same process would have to be repeated at least 5 times, to achieve greater accuracy. Finally, another way to improve the results would be to conduct the experiments on two or three people so that there is more than one person checking the experimental process.
fr_020055	the second test should be different
fr_020056	Plastic B is the most flexible of all the samples. The student could have improved the validity of the results by mentioning the types of weights used for each plastic sample and also mentioning the temperature in which the test was done.
fr_020057	1) Take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length.  Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020058	a.The amount of stretch of the plastic types varies from _10 to 25 mm. Both type A and C plastics are between 10 and 13 mm in length only, while the amount of type D plastic was found to be the same at 20 mm. Type B plastic has the maximum amount of 22-23 mm in the results. b.The student could have used the different techniques for each method and then could have repeated the procedure by changing T1 to T2 and T2 to T1 so that the results were a little more accurate.
fr_020059	The student was overwhelmed.
fr_020060	1. put the weight on T1 and measure 2. remove the weight from T2 and measure
fr_020061	The student passed
fr_020062	Based on the data, one conclusion is that the type of material affects the stretch. Students could improve the experimental design by conducting more tests and using more materials.
fr_020063	"""a: Samples B and D are more elastic than A and C. b: Specify the value of the added weights. And specify if the second test is done on the same samples or if we take """"new"""" samples instead."""""
fr_020064	Construction and demolition waste (CDW), including valuable materials such as plastics, has a remarkable influence on the waste sector. For plastics to be reused, they must be identified and separated based on their polymer composition. In this study, the identification of these materials was performed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which identified the material based on their physicochemical properties. The advantages of the NIR method are low environmental impact and rapid measurement (within seconds) in the _1600-2400 nm spectral range without special sample preparation. Limitations include its inability to analyze dark materials. The identified polymers were used as a component for the wood-polymer composite (WPC), which consists of a polymer matrix, low-cost fillers and additives. The components were first composed of an agglomeration apparatus, followed by extrusion production. In the agglomeration process, the objective was to compound all materials to produce uniformly distributed and granulated materials in pellet form. During the agglomeration process, the polymer (matrix) was melted and the fillers and other additives were then mixed into the molten polymer, being ready for the extrusion process. In the extrusion method, heat and shear forces were applied to a material inside the barrel of a rotating twin-screw type conical extruder, which reduces the risk of burning the materials and reduces the shear mixing. The heated and sheared mixture was then passed through a die to form the product into the desired shape. The protocol described above proved the potential for reuse of CDW materials. The functional properties should be verified according to standard tests, such as flexural, tensile and impact strength tests for the material.  I

fr_020072	could have organized the table more precisely, leaving it more organized
fr_020073	a.  Plastic type B seems to perform best b. I would have let the plastic hang longer / I would have used many more plastic types
fr_020074	a) the length of the plastic types changed with attempts, increasing in size, except for type D which stayed the same. b) with more attempts to see more variation, adding different weights and looking for results in sample D that did not change
fr_020075	The first way: Install the plastic pieces from the upper end and hang in the suspended end of the plastic a weight so that we do the same for all the plastic pieces and leave them for a while and then we measure.  The second way: we apply similar forces on both sides to each piece of plastic and leave it fixed for some time, then we measure the pieces.
fr_020076	a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020077	a.The student's conclusion was that plastic A undergoes more deformation than the other plastics, that plastic D is the strongest of all the plastics, and that plastic C underwent shrinkage due to the experiment. b.The student could have done more tests with the plastics using different weights to test their elongation in different scenarios and could have suspended the plastics longer to get more data for the student to use in his conclusion.
fr_020078	Give correct information and get correct details.
fr_020079	repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples
fr_020080	The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers that was tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer

fr_020083	a. The conclusion is that sample B is the easiest to pull and sample A is the strongest
fr_020084	The student has been outdone.
fr_020085	Sample B is the most elastic while sample A is the least elastic, to improve the picture the student could have also entered the initial measurement of the plastic before elongation to have greater accuracy in the comparison
fr_020086	"""a) In general, mechanical properties and physical properties are not necessarily exactly the same thing. In the context of this activity, however, the property that students are testing (essentially elasticity or deformation under a force [or load]) is a mechanical property and a physical property. When we think of mechanical properties, they are usually related to how the material actually works. Elasticity is therefore a physical property, but in the context of a material that may need to support a weight and its shape may deform when carrying that weight, we consider its elasticity to be a mechanical property. b) The material contains long-chain molecules that are mostly randomly dispersed. Stretching causes the molecules to align, and the material becomes stronger. A ""neck"" will form where the material becomes cloudy, indicating the presence of order among the molecules, i.e. the polyethylene becomes ""crystalline"" in these areas. Large specimens can be prepared from a sheet of polyethylene and an entire class can observe and participate in the stretching of the materials."""
fr_020087	Students concluded that plastic B is the most elastic. students could improve their performance by using Hardness: a measure of a material's resistance to deformation under concentrated compressive load and Toughness: a measure of a material's ability to absorb energy during impacts.
fr_020088	Draw a conclusion based on the student's data
fr_020089	A clamp at the bottom edge of the plastic sample.
fr_020090	The student successfully
fr_020091	a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1). b)Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.
fr_020092	It seems that there was not much difference between the types of plastic.  He could use different types of plastic. Or he could use heavier weights.
fr_020093	a. Sample B is stronger. b. Get the sample material of the same thickness and weight.
fr_020094	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data presented is that plastics are apparently stretchable, but some tests need to be performed to improve the reliability of the data.  Two procedures that should be adopted are measuring the initial size of the polymers and some measurements after certain periods such as _24 hours, 72 hours, to verify that the polymers have not returned to the normal size.
fr_020095	We can use two types of plastic to get a more accurate result, instead of glue, cello tape can be used for the detailed result. Appropriate weight should be added to all types to get a perfect result.
fr_020096	This type of diagram is based on the type of plastic. This type of tables is very interesting.This is separated by the whole quantity based. This is separated in two ways: T_1 and T2. T1 has 10,22,14,20 numbers in their column. And T2 has 12,23,13,20 numbers in that column. So, all in all, this is a very interesting table.
fr_020097	a)Perform a second trial (T_2) exactly like the first trial (T1) , b)Stick the top edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020098	Based on the information, we can see that the type D plastic stretches more in millimeters. The student can improve the experiment in two ways: having control and seeing if the ambient temperature affects the stretch.
fr_020099	all students improve for good and clear design. then careful design for paths.
fr_020100	a) A is the shortest and B is the longest. I wonder if there is a reason why only D is the same length in both b) They need to make sure the types of plastic are exactly the same and find out why the difference between the two trials is different. trials. All other types of plastic changed in length by one or two millimeters.
fr_020101	A. Plastic C stretches optimally, with plastic A stretching less. Although the standard deviation is good, I would prefer to see temperature tested, variable plastic start sizes, and a higher n (T) number.
fr_020102	a) From the results obtained, it can be seen that by adding weights to different types of plastic, each reacts with a different deformation and therefore has different properties. b) The experiment could be performed more adequately with the knowledge of the components present in each of the test objects, as well as the force used for deformation.
fr_020103	a. When a force is exerted on a plastic material, deformation occurs. b. No further conclusions can be drawn as to which plastic is stronger because data is missing. The student could improve the experiment by having samples of similar size and weight. Also, the hanging masses would need to be the same for each sample. Perhaps the stress time should be increased? The table is missing the initial measurement of the sample for comparison. The student could also multiply the tests to see if the sample stretches faster as it is stretched.
fr_020104	There are a number of ways to improve the validity of an experiment, including controlling more variables, improving the measurement technique, increasing randomization to reduce sample bias, blinding the experiment, and adding control or placebo groups.   Controlling more variables is about making sure that as few things as possible change during the experiment.  An ideal experiment is one where one thing is changed and one outcome is examined.  Everything else should stay the same.  So, for example, if you wanted to know how fast balls of different masses would roll down a particular hill, you would change the mass of the ball and keep everything else the same.  You would keep the material of the ball, the point of release, the place of measurement, a method, the humidity of the air, the height above sea level, and anything else you can think of the same.  The more you keep the same, the more likely it is that your result will be valid.   The measurement technique can also be improved.  Maybe instead of measuring something by hand, you could use a computer and an electronic sensor.  Or maybe instead of having one person measure the results, you could have several people take measurements and compare their responses.   Increasing randomization is one way to reduce a particular validity problem: sample bias.  This is when the samples being studied are not a representative sample of the population.  For example, let's say your tests for the effect of a drug and your trials contain mostly white men in their _20s and 30s.  This would not be a good sample because of the lack of range, age and gender. Or maybe you are testing weight loss drugs on people who are already at a healthy weight.  Increasing the randomization of the sample will reduce this problem.
fr_020105	a. Type B plastic was the most stretchy of the _4. Type A plastic was the least stretchy. b. start with the same length for each type of plastic. do a 3rd trial (T3), a 4th (T4), etc., or have someone else do the same survey
fr_020106	a. Plastic B is the one that stretched the most. b. He could have tested the results more than twice, since the results differed. The student should have marked the initial size of the plastic so that we would know what the stretched amount was.
fr_020107	I don't know.
fr_020108	He could have measured the temperature of the environment, in addition to recording the weights used.
fr_020109	If they continue to practice as the first step, they can improve
fr_020110	A.there are different types of plastic, which leads to larger volumes of data. B. The student could share the different types of plastic. And the student could also share the weight of each plastic.
fr_020111	I think I could have put weights in other positions.  I also think that temperature should also be evaluated.  Polymers A and C were found to be more effective because they have less elongation.  In none of the polymers was there a significant variation in elongation from tests _1 to 2.
fr_020112	Sample B had the best result. You can duplicate the samples in the test and time them all at the same time
fr_020113	study of plastic fatigue removal of austenitic stainless steel.
fr_020114	A. According to the results, we can notice the difference in samples A, B and C at T_2. The samples in tension may have been influenced by how the specimens, tensile speed used and by environmental conditions in which the samples were conditioned and tested/ B1. Measure the transverse dimensions of the specimen 2. Compare the curves generated and discuss the influence of speed on the limit, ultimate tensile strength and strain of the specimens.
fr_020115	It would be interesting if the student had noted the initial lengths of the polymers, in addition to the elongations only. Temperature can also influence the results. None of the tests showed much variation between Test _1 and Test 2. The highest elongations were recorded in polymers B and D, showing that they are not as strong when subjected to load.
fr_020116	I need a calculator and measuring instruments
fr_020117	IT'S GOOD AND NICE ON THE NICHE
fr_020118	a) one of the plastics is more prone to stretching than others b) could have used better tools
fr_020119	a).make a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)glue the upper edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020120	Have specified the type of plastic and photos or videos of the experiment.
fr_020121	The student's design was beautiful.
fr_020122	a. Plastic D looks inflexible since the amount stretched does not change between the two trials. b. The student could have repeated the procedure _10 times to get a larger sample or increased the time from 5min to 15min
fr_020123	Plastic B had the most elasticity. The student could have indicated what types of plastic they were using. They could also have done more than two tests to be sure of the results.
fr_020124	THE STRONGEST SAMPLE IS D. THE STUDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ACCURATE BY USING AN APPROPRIATE MEASURING DEVICE FOR ELASTICITY AND STRENGTH OF MATERIALS.
fr_020125	sample b seems to stretch more. but the samples are not weighed at the beginning and we are not sure to have the same initial amount of material. on the other hand i would have looked for the breaking weight for each material
fr_020126	1)The length of the plastic should be measured when the lamp is attached to the plastic 2)The initial length of all the plastic samples should be the same before the experiment starts
fr_020127	a.Plastic type B had the most stretch. b.The student could have improved the experimental design by attaching a clip to both ends of the samples and separating them to test the stretch. The student could also have them stretch without the weights.
fr_020128	A _10 12 D 20 20 These samples are more flexible
fr_020129	A.B._1 = PET or PETE: polyethylene terephthalate
fr_020130	A) With a small margin of error, we can conclude from this experiment that plastic a and b stretch continuously with more malleability than plastic c and d. B) The student would have improved the validity of the study by confining the experiment to a sealed environment that would not increase the humidity that would affect the stretchability of the plastics. Also, repeating the experiment at least _10 more times. Doing the procedure only twice is not scientifically reliable.
fr_020131	Repeat the procedure exactly for the three remaining plastic samples.
fr_020132	Conclusion: Polymers A and B are more stretchable than the others; for improvement the erudite could have heated the different polymers.
fr_020133	Plastics that stretch longer than the others are probably more malleable.I think the student would put a timer on to evaluate how long it takes for the plastic to stretch
fr_020134	2 times of experiment with different results.Need only one person to do the experiment both times. Change the person to measure 2 samples of plastic.
fr_020135	a.Type A has the highest extension compared to the other types b.The plastic samples can be heated and then the procedure can be repeated to get maximum extension
fr_020136	Polymer B plastics is shown an amount stretched longer than the others
fr_020137	a) According to the data of the student we can conclude that there is not a very large difference between the first test and the second test and if differences are observed; they aret a few millimeters; the difference varies from _2 to 1 depending on the type of polymer plastics chosen and remains equal for other type also especially for the type of plastic D b) Another experimental design that the student could have faced could be, to measure the initial length of the chosen plastic and then see the difference between the before and after stretching or better know the mass of the weights added during the experiment and according to each type of plastic and the stretching ottenu evaluate the impact of these weights on the different types of plastics.
fr_020138	a) Remove the weights and the clamp, and measure the length of the types of plastic.Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1) .b)Glue the upper edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.
fr_020139	one. It appears that plastic A was the most stretchy and type C was shrunken. b. They should have performed a few more tests to make sure they were getting consistent results
fr_020140	a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.
fr_020141	The studensa is very large, they are improved the experimental design.
fr_020142	they put it on a clean glass bowl ... keep the measurement of the substance accurately the student must be careful in this experiment
fr_020143	The student data provide the result of the test of the four plastic polymers which has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer
fr_020144	The students are very close
fr_020145	The measurements were taken incorrectly because the plastic should be stressed under the weight and the student could benefit from a larger sample.
fr_020146	weight mass and ambient temperature
fr_020147	A) Based on the student's data, T_1 reveals that plastic B stretches the most and plastic A stretches the least. Looking at T2, plastic B is still the most stressed, while plastic C stretches less than in T1. Plastic D did not change at all for T1 and T2. In contrast, plastic A stretched the most from T1 to T2. B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is to; 1) Make sure each length of plastic is the same length for fairness and 2) Use a timer to make sure each plastic is stretched for the same number of times.
fr_020148	exactly for all three samples
fr_020149	Try to pull it - tensile strength Try to compress it - compressive strength Try to bend it (or flex it) - flexural strength Try to twist it - torsional strength Try to hit it sharply and suddenly -- (like a hammer) impact strength
fr_020150	Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples
fr_020151	A. This plastic loses its strength or tension after being stretched repeatedly B. _1. Do the first 4 experiments at a time 2. Time all the experiments at the exact time
fr_020152	the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is the exercise too good for the students, I am impressed, by how much they improved in both physical and mental state.
fr_020153	a.How the plastic expands due to the weights hanging on the other side. b.Students can use a simple pulley to increase the tension on the plastic sample.
fr_020154	1.Take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length.  2.Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely over the side of the table.  Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.  Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.  5.Remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types. 6.Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.  7.Perform a second trial (T2) exactly as the first trial (T1).  The student recorded the following data from the survey.
fr_020155	Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table
fr_020156	A. The conclusion based on the student's data that I arrive at is that the experiment appears to be effective.  B. I honestly don't see how I could tell what would increase the validity of a scientific experiment.  Maybe using numerical scales?
fr_020157	When you measure the length of the plastic after placing the weights, you can notice how much the plastic has expanded. By analyzing the data, you can see that plastic D kept the same length, meaning that the deformation of this plastic was maximum.
fr_020158	Type B plastic is more elastical
fr_020159	The student succeeded
fr_020160	(A) Plastic D does not undergo deformation. Plastics A and B undergo deformation. (B) Record the length before the procedure for better comparison. Repeat the procedure one more time to get the results in triplicate.
fr_020161	a: we can see that on the first two types of plastic, the second test shows a higher stretch than the first (_2cm for the first, 1cm for the second). Stranger, the third type of plastic is not stretched but shortened. As for the fourth, it was not altered. The 4 plastics therefore have a very different reaction to stretching. b: He could have let the plastics stretch longer than 5min in order to have more significant data. He also should have measured the materials before the first stretch. b:
fr_020162	Content analysis of the media
fr_020163	A - b / B - could have increased the weights
fr_020164	Describe two ways in which the studentfunctions the data
fr_020165	a) Type B plastic is the most stretchy of the group. b) The student must repeat this exercise several times with different weather conditions and evaluate the average result.
fr_020166	the test is not complete. more accurate data is needed and a weight to determine the actual stretching capacity
fr_020167	Remove the weights with great care
fr_020168	Both plastics A and B expanded when stretched, and plastic C shrank. To improve the experimental design, they could have added various weights and recorded with those weights. The student could also have extended the time and recorded the time over several periods.
fr_020169	A.  Based on the first and second experiments, it can apparently be inferred that the longer the time spent stretching the polymer plastic samples, the more they stretch because the weight on the clamp tends to intensify the stretching.  B. Therefore, if a third experiment were conducted on the same plastic samples, there would likely be an increase in stretching.However, it is recommended that students adopt different types of plastic samples and apply the same weight on them as in this experiment to see if the weight added to the clamp would have the same, similar, or different effects on the plastic samples.And they should also note the time to see how long it may take for a particular sample to stretch than others
fr_020170	The data shows that plastic B stretched the most being _22 mm T1 and 23 mm T2.  The students could have improved the experiment if they had done one more trial also they could have been more precise in the procedure for example, they should have told you how much weight you add to the plastic
fr_020171	The student succeeded
fr_020172	The plastic with the most elasticity is type A plastic, the one with the least is type D. With more tests (T_3, T4, ..) the student could have validated the results. He could also have tried with different lengths/weights for the same type of plastic
fr_020173	The only plastics with stretching capabilities seem to be A and B. C having shrunk and D not having changed. It seems strange to get a smaller plastic with C after this experiment, and with D not having changed. To improve the validity of the results, I would have opted for a _3rd test to have more data to compare. And then draw a conclusion.
fr_020174	a. Different polymers deform by different amounts b. Each sample of the same length protruding, weights suspended at the same distance, clamps at the same location
fr_020175	plastic type B is in greater quantity
fr_020176	This type of diagram is based on the type of plastic. This type of tables is very interesting.It is separated by the entire quantity based. This is separated in two ways: T_1 and T2. T1 has 10,22,14,20 numbers in their column. And T2 has 12,23,13,20 numbers in that column. So, all in all, it's a very interesting table.
fr_020177	The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer
fr_020178	Conclusion: type A and B plastics increased in size, while C decreased and D remained the same. The student could improve their performance if they researched the quality of each plastic beforehand to see how they could increase or decrease them. And the student could also improve his results by asking a physicist, for example, to help him.
fr_020179	Some plastics stretch more than others. The student should have reported the original length of the plastic, followed by the amount stretched. Also, the student should have changed some variables for the second test.
fr_020180	From the observations, we can conclude that different plastics have different degrees of stretching. Some stretch when subjected to a weight, while others have the ability to resist the tension exerted by the weight. To improve the experiment, the student could have increased the amount of time needed to hang the plastics for more accurate results. The student could also have performed more than two tests for the different plastics and recorded the average of the length results for more accuracy.
fr_020181	a) Plastic B is the most stretched. Plastic A is the least stretched. Based on these results, plastic B is the weakest and plastic A is the strongest. b) _1. Perform more than two tests. 2.Include more types of plastic
fr_020182	a. Based on the results, plastics A and B are stretchy, C and D are not. b.They can improve the test by making the plastics all the same length to begin with. Students can improve the design by letting the plastic stretch more than once. They could do this in five minute increments, five, ten, fifteen, twenty.
fr_020183	a. The student's result seems inaccurate because the T_1 and T2 results differ from each other despite the same process. The score on both tests must be the same. b. The student must have given the same attention and applied the same energy on both tests.
fr_020184	a ... of this student's current situation and draw conclusions, including comparing his or her scores based on the two letter groupings.
fr_020185	The student had received approximately the same results both times in completing the experiment. For this reason, I would have completed the experiment a third time. I would also have made a hypothesis at the beginning of my research.
fr_020186	a.Two plastic polymers were lengthened, one was shortened and the next remained unchanged. b.Sometimes wind can affect the result. So please use an airtight place for the experiment. And the room temperature can also affect the result of the experiment. Make sure to keep the same temperature.
fr_020187	the student was passed
