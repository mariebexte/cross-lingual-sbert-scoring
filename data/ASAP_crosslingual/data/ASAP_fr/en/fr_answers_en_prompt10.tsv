fr_100001	Black::The color black helps to increase the air temperature in the niche, because darker colors absorb more energy.
fr_100002	White::The lighter the color, the cooler the internal temperature of the niche. White paint had a cooler overall temperature than any other color, so the color would provide a cooler internal temperature.
fr_100003	White::It is obvious that lighter colors keep the interior of a container cooler. For the doghouse, white seems appropriate in a warm climate, but in a cold climate, black would be more advantageous as it would warm the inside of the doghouse.
fr_100004	White::less warm
fr_100005	White::Since white retains less heat, I think it is more appropriate to keep the dog cool
fr_100006	Black::A black dog or cat's eyes are less likely to stand out than their light coated counterparts. When surrounded by dark fur, their facial expressions are less pronounced and therefore more difficult for adopters to read. In many cultures, the color black is associated with evil, misfortune and bad luck.
fr_100007	Dark gray::Darker colors can make the kennel smaller
fr_100008	Black::Black color may take longer to return to base temperature. Test results show that its temperature is higher than any other color.
fr_100009	White::Lighter color makes it cooler inside the niche
fr_100010	Black::Glass pot Lamp Four colored covers: black, dark gray, light gray and white Thermometer Meter Stopwatch are this element produce black color and do not damage.
fr_100011	White::Light colors make the interior of the kennel cooler, while dark colors, since they absorb more energy, make the kennel warmer. Obviously the choice of color depends on where you live, if it is a cold or warm place.
fr_100012	Black::AIR TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE GLASS BOX AFTER _10MIN BLACK 54
fr_100013	White::Lower temperature due to lighter color as indicated by the information given
fr_100014	"""Black::Looking at the results of the experiment and comparing the averages of each color; it is clear that the color """"black"""" absorbs the most temperature."""
fr_100015	Black::Since black is the darkest color, the temperature of the glass jar was highest with the black lid.  The average temperature with the black lid was _53, or 5 degrees higher than the dark gray, and 11 degrees higher than the white lid.
fr_100016	White::The effect of the color white is small compared to the other colors. It passes only the smallest amount of heat into the object. Therefore, white is the best choice to paint the niche according to the results.
fr_100017	White::After _10 minutes of temperature measurement, it will become warm and turn into that.
fr_100018	Black::Dark colors absorb much more heat than lighter ones because they absorb more light energy. Light colors reflect more light.
fr_100019	Black::Black can affect the dog house because it is a pet house and too much color is not necessary
fr_100020	Dark gray::In cold climates, darker colors will absorb the sun's heat and keep the kennel warmer inside. Light colors are appropriate for warm climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the interior of the home cooler.
fr_100021	White::Depending on the color of the doghouse, the doghouse can be perceived as happy or sad. Also, depending on the location of the kennel, when it is in the sun, it will be reflected and can provide more light or darkness for the animal.
fr_100022	Black::T_1 - D 20 This was such a useful answer to this question
fr_100023	White::The lighter the color the lower the temperature. In a temperate climate and depending on the exposure of the kennel it may be desirable to compensate for the heat of the sun by painting the kennel white.
fr_100024	Black::in the black lid when you measure the temperature of the air inside the glass jar the air in the jar returns to the temperature if you turn off the lamp
fr_100025	White::it is white and it will be very difficult to clean
fr_100026	Dark gray::the color white because it keeps the dog house cool
fr_100027	Light gray::According to their experience, Brandi and Jerry should choose a color that brings a pleasant indoor temperature despite the outside temperature. For their experience, they are missing the effect of cold...and the same experience with wood. I hope the doghouse is for them and not for an animal!
fr_100028	White::I chose the white color because it absorbs less energy, so it heats less, as proven by the experiment
fr_100029	Black::the black color can be ideal for a dog that has a shorter coat in a cold environment, because the darker the color, the more heat it absorbs, making the environment warmer.
fr_100030	Dark gray::Don't get in the way of anything
fr_100031	White::The white color absorbs the least amount of energy and thus allows the niche to have a lower interior temperature than with other colors.
fr_100032	White::The lamp is blue
fr_100033	Black::the color can affect the location because the black color absorbs more heat due to the lack of color and this allows it to absorb the entire spectrum of light and heat the.
fr_100034	White::white color will allow to have a lower temperature inside the niche.
fr_100035	White::color changed by science
fr_100036	Black::The darker color of the pots increases the energy absorption in the pot itself. The recorded data supports this, which is why black would be the best color, as it is the darkest.
fr_100037	White::White is the appropriate color because it absorbs the least heat.
fr_100038	White::Brandi and Jerry can choose for the dog they designed a white color that does not absorb more energy because it is a light color. Because if they choose black, it will absorb more thermal energy as a result, the inside of the dog will be affected by the energy.
fr_100039	White::The color has an effect on the temperature inside the doghouse. It would be important to go with the lightest color to ensure that the air inside is as cool as possible for the animal. White being the color that keeps the air temperature the lowest among the different choices available here.
fr_100040	White::Dark colors absorb more light and heat, so the color white will provide a very good climate than the rest of the colors on hot days.
fr_100041	Light gray::For every house, the interior color should be light color to look good. Based on the experience, the light color will reduce the temperature.So, the light color is the best for the niche.
fr_100042	Dark gray::Dark colors help to maintain sleep and keep your eyes healthy.
fr_100043	Light gray::So that you don't have to limit yourself to painting the kennel in colors that camouflage dirt, I chose to make the paint with super washable and stain resistant paint. So no matter what color you choose, cleaning can be done with a damp cloth or sponge, without damaging the paint, believing that it will not harm the health of the pet.
fr_100044	White::White or light gray for the doghouse leaves a lower temperature if you live in a warm climate, white and other light colors will reflect sunlight and help keep your dog cool.Now if the place is cold ideally, paint the house black or dark color, dark colors will attract and absorb the heat of the sun to help keep the dog warm.
fr_100045	Black::This color affected the temperature. this a color that affects more.
fr_100046	Black::different is very huge and this data is very essential. The mass of end is less than the mass of defert. That all tables are equal points. This is a very interesting table.
fr_100047	Light gray::Lamp post is _24 c
fr_100048	Black::Black color will increase the air temperature inside the niche because it is darker than the rest and has the ability to absorb more energy and warm the niche. This is clear from the table above, as it is worth noting that the color black resulted in a higher temperature (average _53) compared to the rest of the colors which are less dark and recorded relatively lower air temperatures.
fr_100049	White::White can reflect light away from the interior of the structure. Therefore, the interior should be cooler. The graph shows that white was the color that achieved the coolest result.
fr_100050	Black::Affect the skin of the dog
fr_100051	White::that the air in the jar returns to the average starting air temperature for each lid color Data
fr_100052	White::it can affect the temperature inside the doghouse
fr_100053	White::The darker the color of the niche, the more energy it will receive, which means that the temperature will be higher. Analyzing the data obtained from the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature values.
fr_100054	White::White absorbs moisture and therefore affects the interiors.
fr_100055	White::This will help the interior of the doghouse to be cooler. This can be seen in the experiment where after testing with the lighter colored lids, the average temperatures are cooler while the darker lids the temperature are warmer.
fr_100056	Dark gray::I think color can affect the temperature of the house due to the absorption of light and heat, the darker the colors the warmer they are, because dark colors tend to absorb light and heat.
fr_100057	White::White is a light color so it absorbs less heat ensuring a much more hospitable environment in terms of temperature as demonstrated by experiment.
fr_100058	White::With a jar with a white lid, the average temperature is _42°C inside the jar, which is 3 degrees lower than with a light gray lid and 11 degrees lower than with a clear lid. Experience shows that the temperature of an enclosed space is directly correlated to the color of the surface exposed to the heat source: the lighter the color of the roof of the kennel, the less the dog inside will suffer from the heat. It is therefore preferable to paint the kennel white.
fr_100059	Black::DOG'S BIRTH TEMPERATURE MAINTAINED AT _24 CELCIUS DEGREES
fr_100060	White::White absorbs moisture and collapses the interior.
fr_100061	White::The color white will have the least effect.
fr_100062	Light gray::It does not influence more
fr_100063	Light gray::THIS COLOR SHOULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO THE DARK
fr_100064	White::The white color will reflect the heat of the sun and maintain a lower and more comfortable temperature in the kennel
fr_100065	Black::because the temperature is higher!
fr_100066	White::the darker the color, the higher the temperature inside the niche
fr_100067	White::With white color, the temperature inside increases the least according to the results of the experiment.
fr_100068	White::Use white or light colored paint on your kennel if you live in a warm climate. White and other light colors will reflect the sun and help keep your dog cool.
fr_100069	::According to the results of the experiment, their hypothesis is confirmed. The darker the color of the lid, the faster the temperature inside the container increases. For a dog house, this will depend on the environment where it will be placed. If the climate is hot, we will avoid a black color and will prefer white. Conversely, if the climate is sunny and cold, black is preferred. Dark colors absorb more heat and increase, in a similar time, more quickly the air of the container. So we can imagine that it will be the same for the interior of the niche even if it is not closed.
fr_100070	Black::the color can affect the interior of the house
fr_100071	Dark grey::GREY IS CORRECT
fr_100072	Black::I don't know
fr_100073	White::The color white is very attractive. It gives a positive energy. It makes them happy. The mood always remains cheerful.
fr_100074	Light gray::Both for winter and summer, the absorption property behaves neutrally_For the kennel, the dog itself can be responsible for a high temperature inside the house. So if we select the light gray, for all seasons, the temperature will be optimal.
fr_100075	Dark gray::make an attractive color...add red color to an impressive design
fr_100076	White::white color would make the doghouse cooler. In the experiment, we can see that white resulted in lower temperatures. It would be good for the dog not to be hot
fr_100077	Light gray::it will really an attractive doghouse color paint..its appearance should be royal..we can add a border pattern to make more beautiful..
fr_100078	White::It is more appropriate to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature moderate inside
fr_100079	Dark gray::The color can offer more comfort by controlling the temperature well.
fr_100080	White::The kennel will heat less in white because this color absorbs less energy
fr_100081	Black::The darker the color the higher the temperature.
fr_100082	White::its color is really beautiful.
fr_100083	Dark gray::increasing the temperature causes the color to change
fr_100084	White::black itself cools down faster than other colors
fr_100085	Dark gray::the dog will attract
fr_100086	White::the effect of white color is less compared to other colors. It only passes a small amount of heat through the object. So white is the best choice to paint based on the results.
fr_100087	White::The darker the color, the more heat is retained in the color. The lighter the color, the cooler the temperature.
fr_100088	White::The color white can affect the niche by keeping the interior cooler temperature than other colors. I know this because on the data table, it shows that the air temp. inside the jar with the lid was _42° C. The air temp inside a jar with a black lid is 53°C. This clearly shows that white is a good color to use because it will keep the inside of the niche cool.
fr_100089	::materialize the space and dare the total look. ... And for this, nothing better than to paint the steps or risers to ... This method may take some time to be assimilated by your dog but, in the end, it proves useful in many ...
fr_100090	White::the white color will not absorb any energy from the environment and will make the kennel less hot. because according to experience white absorbs less heat
fr_100091	Black::the darker the color, the higher the temperature that will be measured. This feature can be used in case you try to have a higher or lower temperature in a certain environment.
fr_100092	White::The white cover gave the smallest temperature increase compared to the other colors. Thus, the white paint on the outside of the niche keeps the inside cool.
fr_100093	Dark gray::Based on the results, the color is based on the temperature that is safe for the dog.
fr_100094	Black::I don't know
fr_100095	White::I would say choosing the white color would keep the dog house cooler based on the example experiment.  The darker the color, the more heat energy is absorbed, so using white makes sense if you want to have a cooler temperature.
fr_100096	White::I chose this color based on the data collected from the experiment
fr_100097	White::The interior of the kennel will be less cold than with another color since white reflects more light than the others
fr_100098	Dark gray::Give correct information and get correct details.
fr_100099	White::According to the results of the experiment dark colors absorb more heat, light colors absorb less.
fr_100100	Black::This color will result in a warmer temperature for the niche
fr_100101	White::The lighter color absorbs less heat, because it is a house with a closed space, it is ideal for the temperature to be comfortable. The white color varies very little between tests, while the other colors reached higher degrees.
fr_100102	Light gray::The light gray cover is what determines a lower temperature rise in the kennel compared to the covers of other colors.
fr_100103	Black::The darker the color of the lid, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.
fr_100104	White::If it is painted white, it will not be as hot and it will be cooler in hot weather.
fr_100105	White::Painting the doghouse white can lower the temperature inside the doghouse, Because white had the lowest average temperature in the experiment (_42).
fr_100106	Dark gray::This color is very suitable for the doghouse, because it can change the state of mind and maintain our happiness.It is also very beneficial to us and very useful.
fr_100107	White::since white absorbs less heat, it is a good idea to make white of the dog house.
fr_100108	White::For a dog house, the ideal is that the temperature inside the dog house is mild, so the ideal is that the paint color is white. As we can see in the experiment, the white color was the one that maintained the lowest air temperature inside the pot, so it should be used in the dog house.
fr_100109	Black::According to the results obtained, this color will warm up the house, avoiding the dog to be cold
fr_100110	Light gray::we can use multiple color paints..and also use attractive patterns to make beautiful
fr_100111	White::According to the results of the experiment, we opted for the color of White paint, in fact because inside the kennel that Brandi and Jerry want to design the temperature will be less important because it is a color of paint less dark, so opting for the white color will allow them to design a kennel that absorbs a lesser amount of heat inside the kennel compared to a dark color for example the black color for the kennel that on the contrary will absorb a significant amount of heat.
fr_100112	Light gray::The interior will remain cooler but not too cold during the hot summer months. Will keep some heat during the winter months.
fr_100113	Light gray::if possible can reduce the steps of the procedure.. I thought if we increase the temperature get the result soon..keep this experiment under vacuum.
fr_100114	Black::I do its pais
fr_100115	White::The results of the experiment are in agreement with the students' hypothesis. So, the color black warms the air the most and the color white the least. The same results can be seen in the table.
fr_100116	White::Deliver accurate, consistent, and reliable information from Big Data,Ensure the success of your Big Data projects with data intelligence that is backed by Data Integration, Governance, and Security.,Integrate, govern, and secure the data your business needs to succeed using a Data Lake,Integrate, govern, and secure the Big Data your business needs to rapidly develop business value
fr_100117	Black::A niche needs to stay warm and according to the results of the experiment, the average temperature for a jar with a black lid stands at _53 degrees celcius. This temperature is an increase of 29 degrees in 10 minutes from the base temperature of 24 degrees.
fr_100118	White::Since the temperature in the jar is the lowest (_42 degrees on average), it is because the white color allows to absorb a minimum of heat, and therefore to restitute a minimum of heat
fr_100119	Black::Calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color Data
fr_100120	Light gray::Light gray has one of the lowest air temperatures as opposed to black and dark gray, which is good because it means less chance of overheating the kennel, especially in summer. The light gray will increase the air temperature in the kennel than if the white color was used, which is useful during the winter season, so that the interior of the kennel does not become too cold.
fr_100121	White::According to the results of the experiment, the air for white cover is the lowest .
fr_100122	White::By using white the interior of the niche will be warmer than the other colors. With a difference of _11°C on average, the black color would give more warmth than white. If you don't use white, you can opt for the two grays because they will give less heat than black.
fr_100123	White::A dog would die if the temperature was too high. That's why I chose white. A lower temperature is better.
fr_100124	White::By using white, the interior of the dog house will have the lowest possible temperature in all situations, this can be proven by using the table provided as a basis, where white had the lowest temperature of all the colors used in the experiment.
fr_100125	"""White::White should keep a form of coolness in the doghouse. White is the most suitable color for this purpose according to the results of the experiment. I assume that the niche is in a ""warm"" place."""
fr_100126	White::Looking at the experiment, white has the lowest temperature, which makes it more practical for a dog house
fr_100127	Black::the dog would be more comfortable in a comfortable environment and make him feel safe.
fr_100128	White::The effect of white color is weak compared with other colors. It only passes the least amount of heat into the object. Therefore, white is the best choice to paint the doghouse according to the results.
fr_100129	Dark gray::the color of the interior can affect the niche because it can illustrate the mood of the frame. You want it to be welcoming and good color
fr_100130	White::White reflects light better than dark colors, so lower the temperature
fr_100131	Black::Black color is the best color to use for the dog house because the dark color tends to produce a higher or warmer temperature which in turn is good and conducive to the dog's dwelling, because with the increase in air temperature produced by the dark colored cover on the experiment, the dog is assured of being kept warm and in good weather against the cold in his house or dwelling.
fr_100132	White::Since the interior temperature is the lowest of the _4 (42). The animal inside will be more comfortable and less warm.
fr_100133	White::According to the experiments, white is the most suitable because it generates a smaller variation of temperature inside the container in contact with the light and thus would allow a more airy place for the making of the animal's home.
fr_100134	White::The white color allows to limit the heating of the interior of the kennel in case of sunlight. A darker color would have generated an important increase in temperature.
fr_100135	White::Black and other dark colors will attract and absorb the sun's heat to help keep the dog warm.
fr_100136	White::It can increase the temperature in the kennel
fr_100137	Dark gray::In cold climates, darker colors will absorb the sun's heat and keep the dog house warmer inside. Lighter colors work well in warmer climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the interior of the home cooler.
fr_100138	White::Reaching cracks
fr_100139	White::The darker the exterior color, the higher the interior temperature. White is the best choice to keep the dog cool.
fr_100140	Dark gray::I think light gray is the ideal temperature, it is very warm and not even too cold.
fr_100141	White::As the temperature of white is in the range of _40-43 degrees, the less the temperature rises, the more comfortable and less hot the dogs will be in the doghouse.
fr_100142	White::This color should keep it a few degrees cooler than the others. According to the data, white does not absorb as much heat as the darker colors
fr_100143	White::The dog will be less heat in the kennel.
fr_100144	White::The color white absorbs less energy. This was confirmed by the temperature measurement shown in the table. The white air had an average of _41 degrees, while the other colors had an average temperature above 45 degrees.
fr_100145	Black::The result of the color goal did not damage the color variant.
fr_100146	White::the white color is a color that is not suitable because it gets dirty quickly the ideal is a darker color.
fr_100147	White::can not affect any feeling of leaving one horn stronger than the other
fr_100148	White::WHITE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL INNER COLOR.
fr_100149	Dark gray::The darker the color of the lid, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.
fr_100150	White::White will absorb moisture and collapse the interior.
fr_100151	White::It will make the inside of the dog house cooler.
fr_100152	Dark gray::It seems that dark gray will keep the temperature constant (_48 degrees Celsius for the three tests), which is important for a dog house so that the dog inside does not have to suffer from temperature variations. This is important for a dog house so that the dog inside does not have to suffer from temperature variations. Also, it allows to have a temperature neither too high in summer (black), nor too low in winter (white).
fr_100153	White::This color can affect the interior of the kennel by making it cooler in the summer months.  In the winter, you would want a darker color to raise the temperature to warm the dog.
fr_100154	Black::_1. Put the black lid with the thermometer attached on the glass jar. 2. Make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24° C.  3.

fr_100171	Black::It can affect the interior of the kennel by making the interior warmer due to the darker colors absorbing more energy.
fr_100172	White::WHITE IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL INTERIOR COLOR.
fr_100173	White::White makes the interior temperature cooler. It is only _42C against 53C for black
fr_100174	White::Black paint gives the coolest temperature. The kennel must be cool to prevent the dog from getting too hot!
fr_100175	Light gray::it is the one that will provide the best temperature for the interior of the house by keeping it warm and cool enough
fr_100176	White::As we know, the generally dark color affects the interior a lot, especially black. so we would learn that black color generally observes the heat while the light color like white does not observe the heat. So we will use the white that best suits the niche
fr_100177	Black::by the method described in the research, this kore will be highlighted inside the house.
fr_100178	White::the tea color of the kennel would be white because the heat of the sun reflects on the white and would be cooler
fr_100179	Black::I believe that dogs like warmer temperatures. That's why I chose the warmer one.
fr_100180	White::The darker color gives a brighter look. It has enough power to absorb energy, the experiment will strongly support dark colors in the time allowed, so I selected black.
fr_100181	::If the objective is to keep the doghouse warmer, the color should be black (_1). Formed in the dog house, but cool, the color should be white (2).
fr_100182	White::In my opinion, the best temperature would be in the range of _41 to 45 degrees.  We can see from the chart that after 10 minutes, the color white increases the temperature of the interior of the doghouse in this range. This suggests that the energy absorption is uniform - neither too low nor too high.

fr_100189	Dark gray::Light gray will balance the dark gray inside
fr_100190	White::If they choose the white color, the house will be cooler, with less heat. If they choose darker colors, the house will be hotter and on summer days, it will be unbearable for the dog to stay inside.
fr_100191	White::A white roof (_2) will help keep the kennel cool. The white roof will keep the inside of the kennel much cooler. As shown in the results table, the white roof can cool the interior by up to 11 degrees compared to a black roof.
fr_100192	Light gray::This color matches the niche best.
fr_100193	Black::The color can affect the interior of the niche because it absorbs more heat
fr_100194	White::If Brandi and Jerry want the doghouse to stay as cool as possible, they should choose the lightest color possible, so white (choice _2)
fr_100195	White::White absorbs moisture and affects the interior of the doghouse.
fr_100196	White::I chose white for the paint color of the doghouse because, as the data shows, white remains the coolest temperature. This is because white reflects the sun's heat instead of absorbing it.
fr_100197	White::this color absorbs less heat, so there won't be as much heat inside the house
fr_100198	Dark gray::It depends on the season. In summer, the ideal color is white, and in winter, black. When choosing a dark gray color that is intermediate. This color had warmed up in the summer but not as much as black was not so bad. And in winter the house had warmed up a bit, but not like the black, but still bringing some good
fr_100199	White::AS YOU CAN NOTE THAT WHITE COLOR ABSORBES LESS HEAT THAN OTHER COLORS THEREFORE IT IS THE BEST COLOR TO USE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. WHITE IS ALSO USED IN HOT COUNTRIES AS A COLOR FOR PAINTING THE EXTERIOR WALLS OF BUILDINGS
fr_100200	Black::Black is suitable for painting the doghouse because black absorbs heat and will warm the doghouse in the evening or winter.
fr_100201	White::White paint will keep the kennel cooler than any other colors. In the experiment, the white pot stayed below _43 degrees Celsius. Cooler than any other pot.
fr_100202	White::it will show the house as a good
fr_100203	White::The effect of white color is weak compared to other colors. It only passes the least amount of heat into the object. So white is the best choice to paint the doghouse according to the results.
fr_100204	White::It can affect the temperature, in warm weather the temperature with this color will be lower, for example.
fr_100205	Black::The black color will warm up the environment more, making the dog warmer during the nights
fr_100206	Dark gray::using this color the kennel will heat up but not too much to keep it warm, at a constant temperature of _48 degrees
fr_100207	White::If the wax color is impregnated, it will heat more
fr_100208	White::The effect of white color is weak compared to other colors. It only passes the least amount of heat into the object. So white is the best choice to paint the niche according to the results.
