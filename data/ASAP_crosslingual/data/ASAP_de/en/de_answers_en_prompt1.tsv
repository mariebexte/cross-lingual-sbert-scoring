de_000002	How much vinegar should be poured in? Should the samples be completely immersed? May they be exposed to the sun? What type of vinegar should be used?
de_000003	In any case, one would have to know the concentration of the vinegar, i.e. how high the acid content is. Then you would have to know how the samples should be stored in the containers. With or without lid? Cold or warm?

de_000017	I understand your question to mean that the same experiment will be done again. So again I need the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. I need specific instructions on how long the samples should remain in the containers and how long you should dry after rinsing with distilled water.

de_000042	-ambient temperature -volume of vinegar -concentration of acetic acid
de_000043	One needs again more mass One must empty the containers And otherwise I do not know sry
de_000044	It would still be important to know the acidity of the vinegar, the amount of vinegar needed and the volume of the container.

de_000067	It is necessary to know from what wood or what kind of plastic has been used. It is also important to know what material the container should be made of, as it should be resistant to the vinegar. It is also important to know how much vinegar to pour.
de_000068	the mass of the 4 different samples, pour vinegar over the samples, determine the weight at the end of the samples
de_000069	to repeat the experiment, the mass must be replenished.additional containers are needed.
de_000070	The free-floating pollutants settle on buildings. When the pollutants now come into contact with water, they oxidize to sulfuric and nitric acid. The rain that falls has a corresponding acid content due to the free-floating particles.
de_000071	"The experiment makes sense as described. It would be interesting to see how large the surface area of the samples is in order to better understand the effect of the vinegar. For this purpose, one could calculate the volume of the different samples. Likewise, after the experiment, it must be calculated how ""acid rain"" would have acted on the materials. This would require information on the concentration of vinegar in the acid rain and also on the purity of the vinegar used."

de_000108	Weigh the 4 samples, place them individually in labeled containers with vinegar. After 24 hours, remove the samples, rinse them and place them to dry for 30 minutes, weigh them again.
de_000109	I think it is important to know how much vinegar is in each container at the beginning of the experiment. The amount of water used for rinsing could perhaps also have an effect on the outcome. Last but not least, it is also possible that the vinegar has changed the containers. This should also be considered.
de_000110	How to determine the mass? How to determine the weight at the end? Is it necessary to dry the samples outdoors or indoors?
de_000111	Ambient temperature, volume of vinegar, volume of dist. Water for rinsing
de_000112	Determine the mass of the four samples. Pour vinegar into each of the four separate, but identical, containers. Remove the samples from the containers after 24 hours and rinse each sample with distilled water. Determine the weight of each sample again.
de_000113	To repeat the experiment, you need different materials suitable for the experiment and a balance that can accurately determine the weight of the materials. The experiment must be performed in exactly the same time as in the first run.
de_000114	The same materials, the same quantity, the same duration of the experiment.
de_000115	The procedure must be repeated, as the destruction will be different materials such as wood and limestone can not absorb moisture during this time. They need a longer interval The composition of the acid rain changes the acidity
de_000116	1- It is necessary to leave the samples in the vinegar for a longer time to observe more relevant results 2- Use other acids besides vinegar such as lemon juice 3- Evaluate rain on buildings made of limestone (with calcium carbonate) or other materials.

de_000125	- To determine difference of masses - To analyze results - To interpret this results
de_000126	After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Put the samples away to dry for 30 minutes.
de_000127	The reduction of pH from 7 to 4 is an important change in the environment, which can be seen in changes in wildlife. There are direct and indirect effects of acid rain. The acidity directly affects the fish's ability to absorb oxygen, salts, and nutrients for life. The acid in the water creates mucus in the fish's gills and prevents it from absorbing oxygen from nearby water. With few exceptions, large fish cannot live in water with a pH of less than 4.8. However, fish eggs and small fish cannot live if the pH is less than 5.5.
de_000128	All experimental observations are a combination of signal, the true effect of a variable on an outcome, and noise, the random error inherent in your experimental technique. Six common means of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio are:  Repeating Measurements on an Item Increasing Sample Size, Randomizing Samples, Randomization Experiments, Repeated Experiments, and Including Covariates.
de_000129	It is necessary to determine: the concentration of vinegar in the experiment, the possible acid concentration in the acid rain and the change in mass of each sample repeatedly after additional drying for one hour
de_000130	more materials the mass at different intervals during 24 hours the pH of vinegar

de_000134	Exposure of materials before
de_000135	1- marble 2- limestone 3- plastic do not need other wood as it has no change
de_000136	I need the mass of the samples at the end, vinegar and again four behalter
de_000137	Size, vinegar concentration, temperature
de_000138	1.the vinegar should be mild 2. care should be taken that the amount of each sample should be weighted 3. the laboratory environment should be very reasonably cleaned and for contaminated
de_000139	Marble, limestone, wood, plastic - Mass at the beginning (g) - Vinegar - 24 hours -Leave the samples for 30 minutes to dry - Mass at the end (g) - Difference in mass (g).
de_000140	Record the mass of three samples. Pour each sample into a bowl with vinegar and stir for 10 minutes. Remove the samples and allow them to dry.
de_000141	Students need to use more different materials. They need to leave the material in the liquid longer. They also need to measure the dimensions of the material.
de_000142	How much vinegar is used? How big are the containers?

de_000144	Mass at the beginning, mass at the end, difference in mass if necessary (not mandatory, as this can be derived from the first values), time information (how long the sample remains in the vinegar), the amount of vinegar.
de_000145	"The actual content of acetic acid in the vinegar used is not observed. There are variations there depending on the commercial brand.  It is also not taken into account that the acid content is much higher than that of acid rain either way. One """"flaw"""" of the experiment is in the drying phase. Since the samples used have different absorbencies, the wood, for example, will take much longer to dry than the plastic."
de_000146	the container must be transparent apply protection methods
de_000147	Exact definition of the materials used (for example, what kind of wood, chemical resistance of the plastic, what kind of limestone (calcite, aragonite, dolomite/ proportion of clay minerals, proportion of organic material, etc.), acidity of the vinegar used, temperature of the fluids

de_000151	One would need to know exactly what vinegar was used. One would need to know exactly what containers were used. (Plastic? Wood? Metal? etc.) One would have to know if certain distilled water was used.
de_000152	Accurate indication of the milligram of each sample before and after the experiment. Use other samples, such as steel, metal, cement, glass, etc. Other time sections are needed, for example 1 hour or 1 week.
de_000153	Temperature, air pressure, humidity
de_000154	This shows how each material dissolves in the solvent, allowing you to know which material is more resistant to the chemical....
de_000155	Amount of solvent
de_000156	On the one hand, one should know whether the materials were completely covered by the vinegar or whether a defined amount of vinegar was added to all materials. The concentration of the vinegar is also important, as is the composition of the individual materials.
de_000157	- how to determine the mass - how much vinegar to pour - At what temperature should wait the containers 24 hours.
de_000158	The pH value of the vinegar. The volume of the vinegar, or whether it was enough to completely cover the samples. Related to this, the shape of the containers and the size or volume of the samples. The exact type of wood (from what species of tree?) and the type of plastic.
de_000159	There is too little information about the substances, auxiliaries and additional equipment used. First, the balance would have to be classified more precisely, if only because of measurement inaccuracies. Then the concentration of the vinegar is missing. I would also change the time intervals in the second experiment.
de_000160	New or different samples of materials; keep materials in the vinegar container for longer than 24 hours; what type of material was it? or What wood was tested? Unprocessed wood? Wood directly from outside? Sanded or varnished wood?

de_000177	Quantity of water Size of container Shape of container
de_000178	It is important that the same materials are used in the repetition in the same quantity and texture. The shape should also be identical, since a different shape of the specimen to be tested could lead to a larger surface area, which would provide more surface area and thus more interfaces to the acid. Thus, the material would etch faster.

de_000218	Acid rain and vinegar do not have the same behavior. You can intensify the experiment with real acid rain. In addition, it is necessary to study the influence of the raindrop on the surface, which also has a direct effect. The third aspect would be to study the composition of the acid rain to better mimic its chemical composition.
de_000219	It is necessary to evaluate different concentrations of the vinegar used and look for a more accurate simulation of acid rain.  You could use real acid rain collected during a real rain.
