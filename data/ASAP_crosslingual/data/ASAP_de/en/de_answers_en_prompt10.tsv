de_000603	light gray :: pleasant
de_000604	white :: The white paint reflects the light instead of absorbing it, thus the temperature does not rise as fast and does not get as hot as the black paint. In the experiment, white was presented with the best results. The white paint is cooler under illumination up to 13°C.
de_000605	white :: The lighter the color of the doghouse the cooler it stays inside.
de_000606	dark gray :: it gets pretty dark
de_000607	white :: The white color absorbs most of the heat and thus keeps the temperature a little cooler.
de_000608	white :: The paint color white would be the ideal color for the doghouse, because Tim and Jan's experiment proved that this paint color heats up the interior less quickly than the other colors. The other colors in the experiment caused the interior to get hotter than the color white.
de_000609	white :: The doghouse should have the color white. It has the lowest internal temperature according to the experiment.  According to the experiment, a white doghouse has 12 degrees less inside than a black doghouse.
de_000610	dark gray :: interior color may be affected by light
de_000611	black :: with black it gets very hot inside the doghouse
de_000612	white :: heats the inside of the hut the least when exposed to sunlight, compared to the other colors.
de_000613	dark gray :: unfortunately, I don't know. that's just the way it is.
de_000614	black :: Black gets by far the warmest with just under 53 degrees Celsius
de_000615	white :: Since, according to Jan and Tim's experiment, white lid paint raises the temperature in the jar the least, a white paint should be chosen for the doghouse to keep the temperature in it low during the summer months. However, the doghouse is open, while the jar is sealed.
de_000616	"dark gray :: - the dog radiates heat, the darker the hut is painted, the warmer it becomes.  - """"Varnish color""""? under certain circumstances the dog does not go in at all! I would prefer untreated wood."
de_000617	white :: The temperature inside the doghouse will rise when exposed to sunlight, but the least of all given colors.
de_000618	white :: The darker the paint color, the warmer the inside of the dog house. A black hutch could get too hot for a dog in the summer. This can be clearly seen in the readings from Tim and Jan's experiment, where the inside temperature of the jar with a black lid is about 53 °C, while the inside temperature with a white lid is only about 42 °C.
de_000619	white :: the paint color has an impact on the temperature in the doghouse
de_000620	black :: Since dark colors absorb more light, it will be warmer in the dog house when exposed to light and thus heats up.
de_000621	black :: mood of the dog and the perception (paint color selection) Color always affects humans and animals Often it is still changed by splits, conversions and attachments afterwards, post-translationally modified.
de_000622	white :: Inside the doghouse stays cooler in the sunlight when white paint is used.
de_000623	white :: The white paint color would reflect a maximum amount of light and thus heat up the hut the least. In the experiment, white showed an average temperature about 11 degrees lower than black, and about 3 degrees lower than light gray.
de_000624	white :: the black and dark gray paint colors are likely to heat up the interior of the hut more than light gray and white when exposed to sunlight, because the highest temperature in the glass was measured under these lids in the glass experiment. Therefore, white would be most suitable so that the hut does not heat up too much.
de_000625	light gray :: - the temperature remains the same, is more comfortable for the dog
de_000626	white :: The hypothesis seems to be correct. The lighter the color, the colder the canning jar will remain, and therefore the doghouse. White might therefore be the best color, especially for summer and in warmer climates. In winter, you should possibly paint the doghouse black (and install some light bulbs 5cm away...
de_000627	black :: The cottage would be warm in summer and probably cold in winter, poor insulation.
de_000628	"black :: Because I have chosen """"Black"""" the doghouse will heat up a little more in the summer. But this is not a problem, because this generally has an entrance that is always open. Here is air circulation and lowers the temperature. In winter, however, a dark color is advantageous because the doghouse does not cool down so quickly."
de_000629	white :: Depending on the color, a different temperature and humidity is built up inside
de_000630	light gray :: The paint color will affect the air temperature, the darker the paint the warmer the air temperature inside.
de_000631	white :: The darker the color, the warmer the hut, so use the lightest possible color (white).
de_000632	black :: Black makes the doghouse warm even in winter.
de_000633	white :: temperature inside increases the least and remains almost constant
de_000634	white :: the darker the color, the warmer it gets
de_000635	black :: there must be enough air in the dog house 2 air speed must be adjusted 3. it must uahc not so cold and not so warm in the dog house
de_000636	black :: As expected, the black paint color leads to the highest internal temperature due to its highest absorption capacity. Furthermore, the determined internal temperature decreases with decreasing absorption capacity.
de_000637	white :: The darker the color the more temperature rise.
de_000638	white :: in summer it is not so hot in the hut, because little energy is absorbed
de_000639	white :: The paint color white should keep the inside of the doghouse a little cooler. Since as Tim and Jan's experiment also showed, white paint absorbs less light than black, and thus less light is converted into heat.
de_000640	white :: The dog house could heat up so much in summer that it is dangerous for the dog. Therefore, you should take a light color to allow the dog a comfortable temperature.
de_000641	white :: the blacker the paint color the higher the temperature inside so use white to get lowest temperature
de_000642	light gray :: I choose light gray so that the temperature is constant in winter as well as in summer. Black would mean that it gets hot, especially in summer, white would be ideal in summer, black actually never, but since white does not give off much energy even in winter, so I took light gray for a constant temperature
de_000643	"white :: You can clearly see that black leads to a much stronger warming (you know it yourself, if you wear something black in the summer - you sweat there much faster, because, as already found out, black absorbs more and accordingly it """"underneath"""" becomes warmer. However, it is questionable whether just a roof color for big differences (smaller ones do, but not like in the experiment. It probably depends on the material from which the hut is built."
de_000644	white :: The result shows that the darker the lid, the higher the internal temperature. This means that black lids have the highest internal temperatures and white lids the lowest (albedo). Analogously, the effect should occur in the doghouse.
de_000645	"white"" :: The darker the color the hotter it gets in the kennel, which could make the dog not so good to live in it. That is why they should take white, because it minimizes the heat."
de_000646	light gray :: The darker the color, the higher the temperature when exposed to sunlight. However, unlike the glasses, the doghouse is not closed, so the temperature inside does not increase so much. Besides, a metal lid releases the heat quickly and for a short time. Wood stores the heat and releases it over a longer period of time.
de_000647	black :: The darker the paint color, the higher the temperatures inside the painted object. Whereby the specific arrangement of the passage has only a small effect on the temperature.
de_000648	white :: The darker the color of the kennel, the warmer it will be inside, so it is advisable to use a light color.
de_000649	White :: The paint color affects the inside temperature. Black paint is suitable for winter, white for summer
de_000650	white :: The darker the paint the higher the temperature in the doghouse can rise (cf. experiment black more than doubled from 24 to 52-54 degrees), such a heated doghouse offers the dog no place of retreat in summer.
de_000651	white :: The darker the color, the higher the air inside heats up.
de_000652	white :: The results confirm the hypothesis made at the beginning: the lighter the paint, the less the air in the doghouse heats up.
de_000653	white :: With black paint color, the interior temperature of the doghouse would be very high in the summer. In winter, the color probably plays a minor role, because there is snow on the hut.
de_000654	white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy
de_000655	white :: The type of paint color is crucial for the internal temperature of the doghouse. White is the most suitable, because the inside temperature is on average the lowest in contrast to the other colors. This is also proven by the experiment of Tim and Jan.
de_000656	white :: the lighter the color, the less it absorbs energy.
de_000657	white :: the darker the color the hotter it gets inside the doghouse
de_000658	white :: Darker the color of the lid, the higher the temperature in the canning jar, because dark colors absorb more energy.
de_000659	white :: The brighter the lower the temperature.The air temperature is color dependent.
de_000660	white :: dark colors absorb more energy. In fact, white is the one that has the lowest temperature. it is a relatively low temperature compared to the other colors.
de_000661	white :: white, so that it is not too hot in the doghouse
de_000662	black :: A darker color results in a higher temperature inside the doghouse. The darker the paint of the lid in the experiment the higher the temperature inside.
de_000663	light gray :: The paint color will also affect the temperature inside, but much less, because it is not enclosed in glass. So that it is not too hot in the summer -> light gray?
de_000664	White :: The color on the kennel cover directly affects the indoor temperature because the darker colors absorb more energy, so light colors are better for maintaining a low temperature. as shown in the Tim and Jan experiment, where the initial temperature was 24 degrees and ended at an average of 53, 48, 45, and 42 degrees for the colors black, dark gray, light gray, and white, respectively.
de_000665	White :: The color on the kennel cover directly affects the indoor temperature because the darker colors absorb more energy, so light colors are better for maintaining a low temperature. as shown in the Tim and Jan experiment, where the initial temperature was 24 degrees and ended at an average of 53, 48, 45, and 42 degrees for the colors black, dark gray, light gray, and white, respectively.
de_000666	White :: White color absorbs less heat and is more suitable for sensitive dogs.
de_000667	lightgrey :: weight of material temperature
de_000668	white :: the brighter the selected color....the lower the absorbed temperature...
de_000669	white :: The paint color affects the temperature in the doghouse, because black light absorbs all colors and thus draws the energy from it. White paint makes the doghouse the least warm, because white paint reflects most colors and thus absorbs little energy. This has been proven by the experiment of the students.
de_000670	white :: the darker the paint color, the higher the temperature in the doghouse.
de_000671	white :: white is best,so that the dog house does not heat up too much.
de_000672	dark gray :: Paint colors, in tests with the run-out cup, it can be assumed in most cases that at an average shear rate of 50 to ... and the following effects do not have a significant impact:
de_000673	white :: The doghouse heats up less due to solar radiation - it is cooler.
de_000674	white :: the thinner the hut, the warmer inside.
de_000675	white :: The greater the darkness of the color, the greater the degree of heat absorption as a basis for the results for black color 54 52 54 53
de_000676	white :: With black varnish, the hut is heated the most by solar radiation, which could be uncomfortable for the dog, possibly even dangerous. With white lacquer the temperature in the hut increases the least.
de_000677	white :: The temperature in the canning jar is higher the darker the color of the lid. This process will be repeated similarly in the doghouse. To build the dog as cool as possible hut would be preferable white color.
de_000678	white :: the darker the color, the more the doghouse heats up when exposed to sunlight
de_000679	white :: Close the canning jar using the black lid to which a thermometer is attached. Make sure that the initial temperature in the jar is 24°C. Place the lamp 5 cm from the cap and turn on the lamp. Measure the temperature inside the canning jar after ten minutes and record the temperature as Passage 1. Turn off the lamp and wait for the temperature inside the canning jar to return to the initial temperature. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for passages 2 and 3. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the dark gray, light gray, and white caps. Calculate and record the average air temperature for each cap color.
de_000680	light gray :: It could be that the color causes that in the summer it might be too hot in the doghouse, if it gets a black paint.
de_000681	white :: White color absorbs little energy.
de_000682	white :: the darker the color, the higher the temperature
de_000683	dark gray :: Of course, you can not compare a sealed glass with a doghouse, but the darker the paint color, the warmer it will be in the hut, because dark materials absorb more energy and reflect less energy. Of course, it depends on where the kennel is placed. If it is in full sun, white or light gray would probably be a good option. If the hut is in the shade or the outdoor temperature is already rather low, dark gray or black is recommended.ä In the interior, the color should not play too big a role.
de_000684	dark gray :: keeps the temperature most constant
de_000685	white :: Jan and Tim's experiment confirmed their hypothesis that darker colors absorb more light and thus lead to stronger temperature rises. Say the darker the paint color, the more likely the inside of the doghouse would heat up. So the lightest possible color, white, is best for the well-being of the dog.
de_000686	White :: The white has the lion's vest temperature
de_000687	white :: the darker the color of the dog house, the more the inside of the dog house heats up. with a white surface you can see in the experiment that the least temperature increase is present. should the dog house therefore protect against extreme cold e.g. in winter black is recommended in summer, however, white because otherwise it becomes very warm in the house
de_000688	white :: The paint color has an influence on the air temperature in the hut. In relation to the experiment, white is best suited, since darker colors would reach too high a temperature.
de_000689	white :: White 42, 43, 41, 42 It is clearer and reflects more light.
de_000690	black :: Black 54, 52, 54, 53 It becomes less dirty and less light is reflected.
de_000691	dark gray :: Dark gray 48, 48, 48 It allows us to be in a not so dark tone.
de_000692	dark gray :: Black 54, 52, 54, 53 There is a darker and colder tone.
de_000693	white :: For the house of dogs lamp is not necessary, because of this the temperature is very high
de_000694	white :: The dark paint warms up more and easier. That is why the temperature in the doghouse is higher.
de_000695	white :: the body temperature of the dog changes
de_000696	white :: with the white color you can lower the temperature so that it is not so hot inside
de_000697	white :: It is necessary that this color becomes clearer
de_000698	light gray :: Light gray 44, 45, 46, 45 Light gray absorbs less energy and is better so it does not get dirty.
de_000699	light gray :: it must be made with lighter colors so that the temperature level is lower
de_000700	white :: A white roof of the doghouse prevents the interior from overheating in the summer.
de_000701	light gray :: should not influence in any way, because dogs see monochromatically
de_000702	white :: The temperature inside the doghouse will be the lowest.
de_000703	white :: Since the color white generates the least heat, I would paint the hut white so that the dog does not sweat so much.
de_000704	white :: due to the outer color it could be very warm inside the hut so bad for the dog white has the lowest temperature
de_000705	dark gray :: I would choose a dark gray for the doghouse, because according to the experiment, the temperature should remain constant and heat up to a maximum of 48 degrees, keeping in mind that the doghouse probably has an opening to allow the dog to go in and out. But constant temperature is good for the climate in the hut and should almost exclude possible mold formation with large fluctuations.
de_000706	white :: The darker the paint color is the warmer it will be in the cabin - if the outside temperature is rather cold over the year you should use black. Is the climate moderate rather light/dark gray Is the climate cold it should be black
de_000707	light gray :: not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer
de_000708	black :: The interior of the hut is heated differently depending on the color.
de_000709	white :: The darker the color, the more is absorbed and the higher the internal temperature rises accordingly. White color is characterized by the lowest absorption capacity, black color by the highest absorption capacity. Especially in summer, black color could be disadvantageous.
de_000710	white :: Due to the white color, the interior of the cottage heats up the least when exposed to sunlight.
de_000711	white :: The paint color can increase the temperature in the dog house. The darker the color, the warmer it will be after some time. Of course, you should therefore take the color that keeps the temperature the coolest.
de_000712	black :: apparently the temperature in the doghouse will be 30°C higher, because the color is dark. according to the results of the experiment, the temperature would only increase by about 18°C with white.
de_000713	white :: the darker the color the higher the temperature inside -> see albedo
de_000714	black :: black is the hottest color because it absorbs the highest light and therefore the energy and is therefore the most comfortable for cultivation
de_000715	black :: The black paint color could keep the dog house the warmest, because the black color is affected by the temperature the most.
de_000716	white :: In summer the doghouse would be more comfortable for a dog, but in winter colder than outside.
de_000717	white :: the interior is not strongly affected by the white color, and when judged by Tim and Ian, it will not be as hot as other colors, it is the most suitable color
de_000718	white :: white colors have a different ability to absorb solar radiation than dark colors, and a white surface becomes less hot from solar radiation; but the long-wave emissions of the two colors are equal and are cooled equally at night by radiation to the firmament.
de_000719	white :: animals have wool, so it is better to keep a lower temperature in the dog house. The color should not cause aggression of the dog, nor should it attract external attention
de_000720	black :: The nursery will warm up faster
de_000721	white :: By using a white color, I prevent the temperature in my kennel from getting too high when the sun is shining. The comfort of my dogs will be improved.
de_000722	black :: It does not matter if the ambient temperature is important
de_000723	white :: if a dark color is used on the exterior surfaces of a house, it will result in higher temperatures inside
de_000724	dark gray :: The hypothesis is: the darker the color of the lid, the higher the temperature in the glass, because dark colors absorb more energy
de_000725	dark gray :: As for the various colors that absorbed the most heat, I think the main consideration might be how dark those colors were. I would think that blue and purple would not absorb as much; unless they were very dark blue and purple. Here's a spectral analysis of heat lamps: http://heelspurs.com/a/led/black3.gif that shows how you might expect heat lamps to emit the most energy in colors toward the red end of the spectrum than expected. That would explain orange - did you try red as well? Why did the colored liquids absorb more heat than the paper covered ones? I hope other experts can contribute, but consider how heat absorption works. With the paper, some of it is exposed to heat, and the paper absorbs the energy, transfers it to the glass (and may also have some air between the two), which it then transfers to the water. In the colored waterfall, the heat absorption is directly in the water, which should be more efficient. Did you have a control without coloring? How much did it heat up?
de_000726	light gray :: the choice of color could also adjust the air temperature inside the cabin
de_000727	white :: Meanwhile in the experiment of Tim and Jan it is demonstrated that to more clarity smaller temperature, if the doghouse is for a warm place, he/she would paint it of white, and if it is for a cold place, he/she would paint it of black.
de_000728	dark gray :: The dark gray color keeps a constant temperature, for children's rooms this is necessary
de_000729	white :: The average temperature is better when the opaque color is in the following order: 1. white 2 - gray light 3-dark gray black
de_000730	white :: I do not think that the color could affect the interior of the kennel
de_000731	dark gray :: I choose a dark gray color because when choosing a black color, because when using black, plants with too much heat can die, and white color does not give sufficient heating. This showed the experiment of Tim and Jan
de_000732	light gray :: the light gray will make the kennel only warm but not too hot, average 45 C, so it is suitable for live animals.
de_000733	white :: White seems to be the reasonable choice. The experiment shows that white has a lower temperature rise with heat. This is advantageous for a kennel, so that extreme temperatures are not observed.
de_000734	white :: The dark background leads to a negative emotional moment. Dark tones also contribute to too high internal temperature in animals.
de_000735	light gray :: light gray is warm, not very hot, so it is most suitable because 45 degrees is not so hot
de_000736	white :: white was the color that stays cooler in all tests
de_000737	white :: white color will be more suitable, because it does not affect the temperature like the darker colors the lighter the color becomes less effective as the temperature rises
de_000738	black :: The color black absorbs the most energy and consequently the temperature is higher in the room where the walls are painted black. This corresponds to the experiment
de_000739	white :: Temperature variations small but white always colder. There are 42 in the starting conditions and 44 in the other from 54 to 54.
de_000740	white :: 1. dark color of paint will increase the indoor temperature continuously. 2. if the dog house is made of wood, the color should be light gray, so it will keep high temperature 3.by Tim and Jan experiment the dark color will absorb energy, so it will increase the temperature 4. it will maintain temperature for some time
de_000741	white :: White - X ° C Black - 1.3 X °C
de_000742	white :: This could have an effect because black does not reflect colors, but it reflects them white depending on the light. A distinction can be made between black 54 52 54 53 and white 42 43 41 42.
de_000743	dark gray :: The only stable color is dark gray, it seems to me the best choice for the interior of the doghouse.
de_000744	white :: The results show that colors have an influence on the temperature inside a dog house. The results from the experiment suggest that white is appropriate in summer and black in winter.
de_000745	white :: according to the brightness, the inside of the kennel will be warmer under exposure to sun rays. White leaves the cabin coldest with an average of 42 degrees
de_000746	dark gray :: Depending on the color of the paint, the sunlight is reflected differently and thus a different heat development takes place inside. Black, for example, absorbs the sunlight, while white reflects a large part. I would choose dark gray because this color gives very consistent results, for all seasons.
de_000747	white :: Based on the fact that the doghouse will probably be made of wood instead of glass, and will also not be airtight, the color will have much less effect than in the experiment
de_000748	white :: white is the ideal color, according to the test carried out, this color keeps the temperatures lower than those that leave it.
de_000749	light gray :: Dark is called the strongest (D. 53°C), then dark gray (D. 48°C), light gray(D. 45°C) and white (42°C). With a dark coat, the dog will be much too warm in the doghouse in midsummer. In spring, when the sky is overcast and the outside temperature is low, the dog might get too cold with a white paint, because not enough heat is stored inside the kennel. Since the doghouse has a relatively large opening (depending on the size of the dog for which it is intended), the air and heat exchange should not be neglected.
de_000750	white :: What substances does the paint emit when exposed to direct sunlight. How much air exchange takes place through the paint.
de_000751	white :: As a hypothesis, the darker the color of the lid, the higher the temperature in the canning jar, because dark colors absorb more energy.
de_000752	white :: At higher temperatures dogs may feel more tired. White: Step 1: 42 Step 2: 43 Step 3: 41 Step 4: 42
de_000753	white :: Perhaps salmon paint inside the dog house could also be painted white, so that it absorbs less energy and thus does not heat up much, which would be unpleasant for the dog. Since we know that white gives off the least temperature or heats up the least, that would probably make sense.
de_000754	dark gray :: The temperature of dark gray remains stable
de_000755	white :: With the white color, the temperature remains the lowest and almost constant at the same time, which is relevant for a doghouse when it is in the sun. With black the stay in the hut would be too warm
de_000756	white :: To make the kennel as comfortable and as cold as possible, the lighter color should be used, because it does not make the room hotter and cooler. This color allows dogs to feel very well
de_000757	white :: In order for the kennel to be as comfortable as possible and provide adequate comfort, the lighter color should be used, as it prevents the room from heating up less and becomes cooler.
de_000758	white :: In summer, a dark color could cause the inside of the kennel to heat up faster and make the kennel uncomfortable for the dog. In winter, the dog will not use the hut wsl, so the color here is pretty sure does not matter.
de_000759	white :: Experiment results prove that darker colors absorb more energy. The darker the color, the higher the temperature. Therefore white color should be chosen
de_000760	white :: The white color ensures less heating of the doghouse when the sun is shining, so there is less risk that the dog will be too warm.
de_000761	light gray :: The color of course has a great influence on the temperature in the doghouse, even if it is not closed compared to the glass in the experiment. Due to the air exchange, the doghouse would not heat up as much as the closed glass. Nevertheless, no black color should be used, especially in summer the doghouse would heat up much too much, the dog could not live in it species-appropriate. I chose the color light gray, because I do not want to take a darker color because of the temperature and white reflects too much.
de_000762	white :: With the white paint, the temperature heated not quite as extreme as the darker colors, so I assume that a dark paint in the doghouse would heat up faster and also stay warm longer. With the white paint, you run less risk of the doghouse staying hot for a long time.
de_000763	dark gray :: Dark gray heats up the least, it is more comfortable for the dog.
de_000764	dark gray :: the air temperature is higher due to the varnish
de_000765	white :: The darker the paint color of the doghouse, the more solar energy is absorbed. This increases the temperature inside the hut.
de_000766	white :: clearly white produces the least heat, which is advantageous for the animal
de_000767	dark gray :: a constant temperature can be obtained
de_000768	dark gray :: Not at all
de_000769	white :: When the color is dark, the interior warms up. The dog hat, which is in the sun, does not have to be dark. It is necessary to use light colors because dogs are hotter because of the hair
de_000770	dark gray :: The darker the paint color, the warmer it will be in the doghouse.
de_000771	white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.
de_000772	white :: White reflects most of the incoming light energy of the shed colors and absorbs the least. Therefore, less heat energy is transferred to the interior of the hut.
de_000773	white :: 42 43 41 42 white color is cooler
de_000774	white :: With a darker paint color, the dog house warms up more. The darker the more. See the table of the experiment. Therefore, light colors are preferable.
de_000775	white :: slightv reflection of light exposure
de_000776	white :: White is here the color that remained coolest during the experiment and is therefore the appropriate color for the dog to look for shade in the hut even on hotter days.
de_000777	white :: From the experiment, it follows that with white color and light, the average temperature is the lowest. Therefore, white is preferred as the color for the dog house, so that the dog is not too hot.
de_000778	white :: It is definitely cooler in the sunshine in the dog house with white paint on the inside of the dog house.
de_000779	dark gray :: paint color dark gray has inner doghouse no effect it keeps the heat the same. The temperature stays the same. according to Tim and Jan s experiment.
de_000780	white :: As in the glass, the doghouse could have an increased temperature with darker colors. Due to the sunlight, the heat is stored and transferred to the interior. A lighter color reflects the color and the kennel is much cooler.
de_000781	white :: color has effect on the interior temperature, the darker the shade the hotter the interior
de_000782	white :: White absorbs more light. This makes the hut is not so warm.
de_000783	white :: The darker the color of the doghouse the warmer it will be in it. Therefore, only white comes into question.
de_000784	white :: The temperature is different when the sun hits the hut depending on which color you use and how much light it absorbs.
de_000785	black :: The black color retains more heat
de_000786	dark gray :: dark gray is chosen because here the temperature does not change at all. it remains constant and there is no danger for the dog.
de_000787	white :: The paint color affects the inside temperature of the doghouse. According to Tim and Jan's experiment, note that the darker the paint color, the higher the temperature of the inside of the doghouse.  The optimal color would therefore be white, as this gives the lowest temperature inside.
de_000788	white :: less energy is absorbed by the white color. most of the energy is repelled. therefore it is less warm inside the kennel than when black color is used.
de_000789	light gray :: With the color light gray, the temperature could not be as high as with the color black.
de_000790	white :: The lighter the paint color, the lower the temperature inside the doghouse.
de_000791	white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.
de_000792	white :: In the experiment you can observe that the darker the chosen color is a higher heating of the preserving jar can be seen. Therefore I would paint the doghouse white
de_000793	white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy....
de_000794	white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.   So the recommended kennel is the white
de_000795	white :: As in the experiment, the paint color could harden too much under the influence of the sun's heat in certain colors.
de_000796	black :: The lighter color made it cooler in the glass.
de_000797	white :: the higher the white content the cooler
de_000798	white :: Dark colors draw heat and white color reflects the light, hence the results.
de_000799	dark gray :: since the doghouse is open, the color is not critical for the temperature. The dog should be warm. A dark roof is easier to maintain.
de_000800	"white :: Depending on which one you choose sometimes warmer sometimes colder (theoretically) According to the results black has an extremely warm effect and the lighter the color becomes the """"cooler""""."
de_000801	white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy
de_000802	white :: The paint color affects the temperature of the doghouse. If you use black varnish, the temperature rises faster and is also higher at the end. If you use white varnish, it stays a little cooler in the doghouse. In the experiment, according to the average, there was 11 degrees difference between white and black, so a white varnish would be more comfortable for a dog.
de_000803	white :: The lighter the color of the hut, the more light is reflected and therefore the hut heats up less.
de_000804	white :: In case of strong sunlight, the doghouse with a white roof would heat up less than with a black, dark gray, light gray roof.
de_000805	light gray :: The paint color could affect the internal temperature of the doghouse, because the experiment has shown: The darker the color, the warmer it is in the doghouse.  Therefore, in summer, white seems to be better, because it is warm anyway and a dark paint color makes for unbearable temperatures, while in winter, where it is cold, a darker paint color contributes to a pleasantly warm temperature . Therefore, light gray or dark gray seems to me a good compromise.
de_000806	white :: Darker color retains more heat, absorbs, heats up further.  The lightest color (white) makes the most sense, because the temperature is the lowest / closest to the original temperature.
de_000807	white :: It is too hot for a dog in this dog house. Temperatures above 40 °C are too hot for a dog, the paint colors are not suitable. Even the lightest color white is too hot and all other colors are even hotter.
de_000808	white :: Just like the normal color: dark heats more, white less!
de_000809	white :: The darker the color, the warmer it will be inside. White color would be recommended, so that the dog is not too warm.
de_000810	white :: Light colors are suggested because they reflect light and external heat.
de_000811	white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.
de_000812	white :: the inside of the doghouse will not be heated so much as a result
de_000813	white :: Analogous to the experiment, it is likely that a white paint color absorbs less energy than the other colors available for selection, and thus the air temperature increase due to irradiation is lower. Instead of artificial lighting by a lamp in the experiment, the doghouse is exposed to the sun in reality, which, however, is expected to produce similar results. In the experiment, it can be seen that the air temperature rise is lowest for white lid color compared to the other colors tested (about 12°C lower than black lid color after 10min).
de_000814	light gray :: Black color absorbs the light.
de_000815	white :: the darker the color, the higher the temperature in the cabin, the worse for the dog (at least in summer).
de_000816	white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy
de_000817	white :: The lighter the color the cooler the hut stays or heats up less.
de_000818	white :: From my point of view, this would hardly affect the color of the kennel.
de_000819	white :: The color black absorbs the light and heat of the environment and transmits them to the air enclosed in the kennel, for which they agree bright colors that reflect the light and heat, so that the dog has a better comfort.
de_000820	white :: In the experiment of Tim and Jan it is observed that the darker the surface, the higher the temperature inside the container. This is because the dark colors are absorbed by the surface and the heat is transferred to the air in the doghouse by convection and warmed. Lighter colors, like white, reflect light and heat, and the surface stays cooler, as does the inside of the kennel.
de_000821	white :: The white color on the cover would reflect more heat, so the interior would stay much cooler.
de_000822	light gray :: it does not affect anything
de_000823	white :: Depending on the choice of color, the doghouse is heated to different degrees by the sun's rays. A black hut has by the adsorbtion, as described above, a higher temperature to the consequence than the white. Best eh build under a tree.
de_000824	white :: The darker the color, the more heat it absorbs and releases into the dog house. Therefore, a white doghouse would be cooler than a black one. Incidentally, one encounters this also in the houses in the Mediterranean- there is predominantly painted light or even whitewashed from the outside (see Greek islands and mainland), while in our latitudes mostly with gray or red stone houses are built.
de_000825	black :: black absorbs energy
de_000826	white :: Lighter color makes the cottage less heated in the sun, which makes it more comfortable inside in the summer. This is confirmed by the results in the experiment.
de_000827	white :: The brightness of the color affects how much light is reflected and, accordingly, the temperature. The brighter the color, the more light is reflected and the less the temperature heats up.
de_000828	white :: In summer, the doghouse does not heat up as much as with black paint.  White has the lowest temperature values in the experiment.
de_000829	white :: I would go with white because it allows heat to penetrate the least than the darker colors.
de_000830	white :: If the doghouse is painted white, it will not heat up as much under sunlight as if it were painted darker. However, the temperature rise in the doghouse will not be as extreme as in the jam jar, because the doghouse is open in the front and so air can circulate.
de_000831	white :: The darker the varnish, the faster and further the air inside heats up when exposed to sunlight. Since too high temperatures are unhealthy for the dog, the lightest possible varnish should be used.
de_000832	white :: The darker the paint color, the more heat radiation is absorbed. Accordingly, you should choose the color depending on the desire of the dog. If a little more temperature is desired: choose the color darker, otherwise I find white quite okay.
de_000833	white :: The darker the color is the hotter it will be inside the doghouse.
de_000834	light gray :: Depending on the paint of the hut could be strong temperature fluctuations inside at different times of the day. For example, a black painted doghouse would probably be unbearable for the animal in the summer, but more comfortable in the winter.
de_000835	white :: White has a weak effect on the temperature, so this would be the best choice. The dog should not be too warm in the summer.
de_000836	white :: is coolest in the hut then for the dog
de_000837	white :: As it is said and shown that dark colors absorb more energy, which translates into an increase in temperature, it would be ideal to place colors as bright as white, for example.
de_000838	white :: Depending on the outer color of the doghouse, higher or lower temperatures may occur inside when exposed to strong sunlight.
de_000839	white :: The experiment is not quite transferable to the doghouse, at most in midsummer, when the cabin is illuminated by the sun for several hours. Then the white color should be the best choice, otherwise the dog will be grilled.
de_000840	white :: no idea
de_000841	white :: Dark colors make it warmer in the hut, because dark colors cause higher temperatures (attract / store heat).
de_000842	black :: The color has significant influence on the temperature, but the specific passes instead do not.
de_000843	white :: The darker the paint color, the higher the temperature in the doghouse. This is also reflected in Tim and Jan's experiment. The temperatures in the canning jar are about 10 °C higher with a black lid than with a white one.
de_000844	white :: The darker the color, the hotter it gets in the cottage in the same time.
de_000845	white :: A dog house is constantly exposed to the sun. This causes the interior to heat up. To avoid too much heat, the doghouse should be painted on the outside with a paint that absorbs little heat. From the experiment, it appears that of the paints tested, white paint absorbs the least amount of heat. Thus, white paint is the most suitable for painting the doghouse.
de_000846	white :: The perception of colors results from the reflection/absorption of certain portions of the visible light, where black means relatively low reflection and white means relatively high reflection. The absorption of light also affects temperature and so black objects should heat up faster in the sun than white ones. The experiment of Tim and Jan supports this thesis.
de_000847	white :: It can be seen that darker colors lead to heating much faster (as evident in the experiment above). Especially in direct sunlight, colors like black would have to heat up very quickly. Accordingly, in summer, a hut of white is highly recommended. In winter, however, the color black can probably store heat longer, which is why a darker hut might be more advisable in winter.
de_000848	light gray :: The darker the color of the paint, the more the temperature in the hut will rise. Therefore, not black and not dark gray, because in the summer the temperatures in the hut would reach dangerous,unhealthy heights for the dog. White will not warm up the inside of the kennel at low temperatures, especially in winter. Thus, light gray is the best choice, the slight measurement deviations D1, D2, D3 are not significant. Although dark gray is the color that is the only one that provides stable readings, reliably aborbs, I consider this color to be risky to the dog's health because of the rather strong absorption of solar heat and its release into the hut interior, like black, when outside temperatures are high.
de_000849	white :: The darker the color, the warmer the inside of the doghouse (see experiment). Therefore, white, so that the dog is not too warm and suffer.
de_000850	black :: As a hypothesis, the darker the color of the lid, the higher the temperature in the canning jar, because dark colors absorb more energy.
de_000851	white :: It becomes warmer the darker the color is. White is the coldest.
de_000852	white :: Yes darker the paint the warmer it gets in the doghouse.
de_000853	white :: As the experiment shows, the darker the color of the roof, the more the doghouse heats up inside, so the best color is white to prevent the doghouse from heating up too much
de_000854	white :: Calculate and record the average air temperature for each shutter color.
de_000855	White :: The light color will block more sunlight and so the dog house will not be as warm as if a darker color was used.
de_000856	white :: A dark to black paint could cause the temperature in the doghouse to rise when exposed to sunlight. A light color paint will result in a relatively constant temperature.
de_000857	white :: The temperature in the doghouse should rise slightly - but less in a white doghouse than in a grey or even black doghouse
de_000858	light gray :: white, in summer it is not so hot, though in winter very cold, you could maybe take light gray
de_000859	dark gray :: she we not too bright
de_000860	white :: The paint color has the effect that the darker the color, the warmer it gets in the doghouse.
de_000861	black :: It becomes warm inside the doghouse when exposed to sunlight.
de_000862	white :: The white color will probably heat up the doghouse the least than black. Basically, you can say the darker the color, the warmer it will be.
de_000863	white :: neat
de_000864	light gray :: black would be too hot in summer, white does not provide enough energy in winter, therefore the golden mean light gray
de_000865	white :: By choosing lighter colors, the doghouse can not heat up so much in the summer, so the dog is not exposed to great heat when the sun in the summer bangs down fully. However, in winter you have the problem that it is colder in the doghouse, because the white color radiates the sunlight as far as possible.
de_000866	white :: the dark colors store the most energy and are therefore unsuitable as a paint for the doghouse
de_000867	white :: The experiment showed that with white paint the temperature rose the least. It is to be expected that a cabin painted white is the coolest for the dog in the summer.
de_000868	hellgrau :: Hello, unfortunately this task is not feasible for me,I have always been a niete in chemistry.
de_000869	white :: The lighter the varnish, the less the interior of the jar heats up. This can be concluded from the results of the test series, in which the interior of the preserving jar heats up with the same irradiation depending on the color of the varnish (white varnish: lowest temperature increase).
de_000870	white :: the darker the color the hotter the hut will be
de_000871	light gray :: can affect the interior if it is not the right color
de_000872	white :: with the color, the inside temperature would not rise as much in sunshine as with the other three colors. but i would put the doghouse in the shade for that reason.
de_000873	black :: The requirements for the cottage are not clear. Will the dog spend there also at night? If so, a black color would be advantageous to retain heat longer, as it is colder at night (and in winter) If the dog is only in his hut during the day and summer would definitely take the white color to keep the hut cool.
de_000874	white :: white stays coolest , black is not recommended , will be too hot . the brighter the cooler
de_000875	white :: The darker the paint, the warmer it will be in the doghouse, because darker color absorbs more light, this energy is converted into heat. Since there was the smallest increase in temperature with white paint, this color is best suited for the dog house.
de_000876	white :: Through Tim and Jan's experiment, it has been found that the color of the paint has a great influence on the internal temperature. The least heating took place with the color white and this should therefore be applied to the doghouse.  This will still cause it to heat up inside, but not as much as other colors.
de_000877	dark gray :: the darker the color, the warmer the interior becomes when exposed to light. i would use a dark color for the dog so that it does not freeze, but not black so that it does not get too hot
de_000878	white :: with white color the temperature will not rise as high as with the other colors. however, the temperature will rise when the hut is exposed to sunlight. therefore, you should place the hut in the shade
de_000879	white :: The darker the color of the doghouse the more the dog's body heat will raise the temperature.
de_000880	white :: A dark color ensures that the temperature inside the dog house heats up to an unbearable temperature for the animal. By using a light color of paint, you can make the temperature more bearable for the dog.
de_000881	white :: The color of the doghouse absorbs different amounts of solar radiation energy. The brighter the color, the more light is reflected and the less energy is absorbed. Therefore, the doghouse should be as bright as possible to cause a more comfortable internal temperature for the dog. The results also prove Tim and Jan's experiment, as the canning jar with the white lid had the lowest internal temperature.
de_000882	black :: The black painted roof absorbs solar energy and transfers it as heat to the interior.
de_000883	White :: With all other colors, the temperature in the dog house could rise too much and endanger the health of the animal.
de_000884	White :: The darker the paint color the warmer it is in the doghouse.
de_000885	White :: Depending on the color chosen, it will heat up faster or slower inside the doghouse when exposed to sunlight. With black, it will become very hot within a very short time. With grayscale, this development is somewhat less pronounced. With white paint, it will remain coolest inside the kennel.
de_000886	White :: The experiment has shown that a vessel with a white surface is heated less by irradiation than one with a different color surface. Therefore, the hut with white paint will probably heat up less by solar radiation.
de_000887	White :: The darker the warmer, so it would not be optimal for the dog in the cottage in the summer. Vorallem if the sun is on the hut.
de_000888	White :: The experiment has confirmed the hypothesis of the boys. The lighter the color of the lid, the lower the temperature in the jar. Accordingly, the also white color of the doghouse will help it not to heat up so much.
de_000889	White :: Presumably, the doghouse heats up more under sunlight with dark colors than with light ones, accordingly, a light coating should be chosen if this is not desired. However, significantly more factors than in the laboratory test play a role.
de_000890	White :: The darker the color, the higher the temperature in the sunlight. Therefore, choose white, otherwise the dog will be too warm in it.
de_000891	White :: The experiment has shown that the color of an object can affect the temperature inside an object, so darker colors heat up faster when exposed to light. So a dark paint color could increase the temperature inside the hut.
de_000892	Dark gray :: As the experiment shows, the temperature with this color always remains the same, with the other colors a fluctuation is seen
de_000893	White :: The lighter the paint color, the warmer the air temperature in the doghouse (assuming that Jan's and Tim's results are applicable to the doghouse, because of the different construction)
de_000894	White :: In summer, a black color heats up the dog house too much. The white color reflects the sun more and gives the dog shade in summer
de_000895	White :: I would take white, because the cabin does not heat up so much.
de_000896	White :: The color white reflects the light and thus less light energy is converted into heat.
de_000897	White :: White does not attract the sunlight so much, so the temperature in the doghouse does not rise so quickly.
de_000898	White :: As the experiment shows, the color of a canning jar lid has an influence on the heating of the air inside the jar when irradiated directly with a lamp: the darker the lid, the more the air inside heats up. The tendency of this observation can probably be transferred to a doghouse, the roof of the doghouse and direct sunlight. Accordingly, the interior of a doghouse with a black roof would heat up significantly more than that of a doghouse with a white roof when the sun shines on it.
de_000899	White :: Hypothesis confirmed: The darker the color, the more likely to retain heat. Whereby glass is not equal to wood. Since cells denature above 40°, I would not risk a hot dog.
de_000900	White :: The darker the paint color of the dog house, the hotter it will be inside when the sun shines. Assuming that we want to keep our dog from overheating in the summer, we should paint the kennel as light as possible. However, if the goal is to keep the kennel as warm as possible (for winter temperatures), it would probably be better to paint the kennel black. In summer, the dog would not necessarily have to lie around in the hut, but lie down in the shade of the hut outside.
de_000901	White :: The paint color white would not heat up the dog house too much. So the dog could also visit it as a shady place.
de_000902	White :: In summer a black roof would be too hot
de_000903	Light gray :: The darker the paint, the warmer the doghouse. Now, of course, the question is how warm it is outside and how warm the dog would like. To be on the safe side, let's take a gradation in the middle and none of the extremes.
