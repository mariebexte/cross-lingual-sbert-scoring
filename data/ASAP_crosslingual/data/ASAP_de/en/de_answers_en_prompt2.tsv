de_000302	is ok
de_000303	More detailed information. Previous length. Current length.
de_000304	"They are obviously different plastics with different material properties or the same plastic but cut differently. One would have to """"standardize"""" the plastic samples somehow. , i.e. exactly the same size, shape or weight. Weights should also always be the same and I would not simply stick the samples to a table but fix them freely on top with a clamp and let them hang freely."
de_000305	with D2 it is more accurate search for other types of plastic
de_000306	In the first two samples, the material still stretched. This no longer happened with the other specimens,
de_000307	a) Plastic type D is the most stretchable while plastic type A is the least stretchable. b) There is no indication of how much weight was used. A run without weights would determine the influence of gravity
de_000308	The stretching of the plastics is similar in both runs. To improve the results, the run must be repeated more often and the weights must be documented as to how heavy they are.
de_000309	it can easily collect and obtain samples of polymer resins, which is their extensibility
de_000310	plastic a expands the most
de_000311	a) plastic B has the greatest ductility, b) better fix plastic sample (not glue - because inaccurate - better clamp etc) - one-time longer hanging time
de_000312	unfortunately, i don't know. that's just the way it is.
de_000313	Plastic types A and B stretch much less than C and D - the initial length could have been specified so that the percentage stretching could be calculated
de_000314	Plastic type B stretches the most, plastic type A the least. More experimental runs could have been made. The strain should be noted.
de_000315	Conclusion: plastic can deform plastically. Improvement: do not glue ( possible chemical action) but clamp.
de_000316	a. The results obtained in the two runs vary only minimally b. Specification of the plastic material Specification of the plastic density
de_000317	Plastic types A and B become more elastic with increasing elongation. Plastic type C, on the other hand, becomes more inelastic and D does not change its elasticity with strain. The validity of the results could be improved as follows: Perform an increased number of experimental runs for each plastic type, with new samples (to increase statistical significance). Add more runs (e.g., D3). Logging the temperature.
de_000318	"Conclusion: Plastic type B is the most ductile. Improvement of the test set-up: more test runs for each type of plastic, perform test with different """"hanging times""""."
de_000319	Start the 2 tests in parallel to ensure that the tests are identical. Start tests with different lengths of the plastics and compare them with each other.
de_000320	Hang weights on the clamp and let them hang for five minutes. Remove the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
de_000321	a. Plastic is stretchable, depending on the type of plastic. b. Exactly where and how is the clamp attached? What weights are used? Is the same weight always used?
de_000322	a. The data suggests plastics B and D are more extensible than C and A. b. The student should have looked for an identical cross-section of the stretched plastic and set the stretched distance in relation to the initial length.
de_000323	a) Plastic type D does not stretch Plastic type C appears to shrink instead of stretch b) The masses of the weights vary Perform more than two runs
de_000324	- why does the plastic type D not change?  Presumably it is hard plastic, the sotff is firmer and more resistant, than A-C - better result: use raw materials comparable in condition and consistency
de_000325	a. It depends on the type of plastic whether the stretching is greater on the 1st or 2nd pass, or whether it is the same. b. You could have decreased/increased the time on one of the passes. The fastening (nail instead of glue, for example) could be more stable.
de_000326	No idea
de_000327	The student's data is not usable. - The weight would have to be named exactly -The weight must be the same for all samples -The materials must be known -The differences of the materials (expansion coefficient or expansion diagram).
de_000328	"Object D shows no changes ""Object C becomes smaller and contracts during overvoltage."
de_000329	a) You have proven how flexible the materials are. b) You could have used a tripod instead of a table. And you could have made several passes with different weights.
de_000330	Plastic A and B are more stretchable in the second pass, C is less stretchable and D is just as stretchable as before. Make more passes.
de_000331	Plastic B is the most stretchable, then D, then C, then A. A also has the highest variance. The weights could have varied in severity. He could have also varied the time period.
de_000332	a. Plastic type D is the most stable and insensitive to mass impact b. Specify weight and original length of plastic type.
de_000333	The plastic becomes longer due to the weight - Carry out more specimens - Use plastic of different thicknesses
de_000334	1.first of all to be honest, I have no idea about it 2. it is enough if the one plastic type to use
de_000335	It can be concluded that the specimens have stretched as expected.  It should be specified with what and how bonding is to be carried out (spot or area bonding).
de_000336	a. Polymer B has the highest extensibility, A has the lowest. b. Use a longer specimen More than 2 trials
de_000337	do not understand the question
de_000338	a) Plastic type B is more ductile than plastic type A b) More runs would improve the statistical significance of the experiment. Samples at different times do not measure only after 5 minutes of force application.
de_000339	The plastic types have stretched differently in 2 identical test runs, which means that the plastic does not always behave in the same way. b.) The same length in both tests and the same number of weights in each sample.
de_000340	a B and D stretch the most data are quite similar in the second pass so relatively good results b more passes other attachment to the table
de_000341	a. The specification of the size of the samples is missing b. All samples must be of the same size and weight
de_000342	The fact that D1 and D2 always deviate (except for plastic type D) shows or can be concluded that it is not possible to write down a fixed value, since there is always some deviation. The experiment could be improved by carrying out several tests D1 - D10 (e.g.) and taking the mean value so that the deviation is as small as possible.
de_000343	a. Plastic A and B have stretched, plastic D has kept the length and plastic D should even have shortened b. The length of the plastic parts should be identical at the beginning of the measurement. Use reasonable vice instead of gluing, because gluing surfaces and thicknesses are different (depending on the plastic). Temperature should be stable between measurements.
de_000344	The polymer has grown by a total of 22 and 23 mm, so 45mm in total. You could have taken different weights, which would have given you different results.
de_000345	a) Each of the samples expands differently, but by approximately the same amount per unit time. b) First, the student should have given the original length of the samples. This would have allowed him to calculate the percentage expansion. He could also have performed at least one series of measurements with different weights for comparison.
de_000346	a.) While some plastics (A, B) increase in length, others (D) remain stable, or (C) even shorten. b.) Instead of a chemical adhesive for the purpose of fixing the plastic at the upper end, which could have a manipulating effect on the nature of the plastic, a mechanical one should be chosen, e.g. by stapling.
de_000347	He could have repeated the procedure and matched D2 to D1.
de_000348	He could choose better fastening. You could do all the tests at the same time
de_000349	Use 4 specimens of equal length, hang the specimens on a fixture provided for this purpose and do not stick them to the table, measure the length in the stretched state to have another comparison value.
de_000350	a. The experiment was not performed in exactly the same way. b: The attachment of clamp and the one to the table should have been done in exactly the same way in each case.
de_000351	Conclusion: Plastic A is the most ductile. Possible improvements: 1. make sure that the room temperature is constant for each run. 2. make sure that the lighting conditions are constant for each run. 2. make sure that the lighting conditions are constantly the same for each run.
de_000352	a.: Polymer A seems to stretch more when exposed to a weight for a longer time, for the others the difference is too small or non-existent. b.: Use heavier weights; measure the length of the plastics without weight.
de_000353	Follow the prescription that researchers give you is important for effectiveness
de_000354	a. Plastic type A is the most stretchable with 2 mm. This is followed by plastic type B. Plastic type D cannot be stretched and plastic type C even shortens by 1 mm. b. Higher number of samples. Higher output variance.
de_000355	Use nail instead of glue to hold the plastic sample better, and maybe use heavier weights. Lead at least 3 pass through.
de_000356	a.For D, there was no further stretching after the second pass was made b.Uniform length of plastic specimens Uniform position on the specimen to which the adhesive or adhesive strip is applied
de_000357	Plastic type D; Elongation zero
de_000358	You should try from what weight the plastic is extended.also longer hanging could help
de_000359	the dimensions are important and the brackets its use is essential and the length must be accurate the resin is variable and they are 4
de_000360	- Measurement in vacuum - measurement under uniform temperature
de_000361	a.  Plastic type A will be more stretchable B C D will remain constant. b. Attach plastic specimen to bottom of table so that the force effect is straight to the floor.        Further passes.
de_000362	a. The plastic specimens elongated by almost the same length in both runs. b. The absolute elongation in mm says little, for helpful measurement data one should relate it to the total length. One should also distinguish between elastic/plastic deformation, after a certain time the deformation could decrease again.
de_000363	A possible improvement would be a change in the types of plastic used. Put different weights and calculate the points of plasticity and fracture.
de_000364	The data recorded by the analyses say that in all the experiments there is homogeneity in terms of the length of the layer, therefore the material is relatively the same.  A possible improvement would be to change the types of plastic used. Put different weights and calculate the points of plasticity and fracture.
de_000365	The plastic types have their own properties due to different molecular structures. Heat analysis should be performed. As well as a weight / mass determination
de_000366	weight of material temperature
de_000367	the temperature of the environment would have had an influence...  use another clamp...( larger holding surface )
de_000368	a) Plastic types A and B are minimally stretchable, C has become less stretchable and D has remained so. b) The student should have used the exact designation for the plastic type, instead of A,B,C and D. Also, the experimental run should be better labeled, e.g., divide the runs more precisely.
de_000369	On the first pass, the samples of plastic stretch a lot. on the 2nd pass, only 0.2mm. i can't think of 2 other possibilities.
de_000370	the second run has different values.take another plastic sample and repeat the whole process again.
de_000371	These properties can be investigated using standardized test methods and compared in different products.
de_000372	Plastic type A has expanded the most. The student could use uniformly sized pieces of plastic. Likewise, a measurement when the plastic pieces are loaded (and not just after loading) would be interesting.
de_000373	before also measure extend duration
de_000374	a) depending on the material, it will stretch more b) take weight measurements C) hang from the ceiling
de_000375	Either he used the same sample 2 times each and the extensibility varied with repetition, or he used new samples that were a different length or thickness, or the weights were not the same weight, or the outside conditions changed (e.g. temperature), or he simply measured inaccurately. He would have had to take a new sample of each plastic each time, all exactly the same length, thickness, and weight. He would have had to keep the temperature in the room constant.
de_000376	The student became more familiar and consistent during the experiment. Directly perform multiple trials on one plastic sample. Conduct more than two trials on each plastic sample.
de_000377	a. All plastics are stretchable b. Note length at beginning Note weight of weights
de_000378	Take a sample of a plastic and measure its length. Tape the top corner of the plastic sample to a table so that it can hang freely down the side of the table. Attach a clamp to the bottom corner of the plastic sample. Hang weights from the clamp and let it hang for five minutes. Remove the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic. Repeat the procedure for the remaining three plastic samples. Perform a second run (D2) exactly like the first run (D1).
de_000379	From the data, it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion about the ductility of the plastics. Is a new piece of the plastic used in the 2nd run or the one used in D1? 1st possibility: Perform several runs with new pieces of the plastic again and again and take the mean value of the stretched lengths over the number of runs as a measure. 2nd possibility: Perform further runs with longer hanging time of the weights and also runs with larger weights.
de_000380	Apply different weights. When measuring temperatures below and above zero.
de_000381	They are different plastics because they stretch differently . You can also measure the length without removing the clamp. You can also measure the length without removing the weight.
de_000382	a. The experimental setup for these scales may be too inaccurate. Since the difference is only a few milimeters, it could be related to measurement inaccuracies. Weights should not have been removed. b. Room temperature could play a role with certain materials. Measuring strip in front of a background with recorded scales, so that one can directly read the measurement result and does not have to remove the weights. This could cause the strip to recede at different rates depending on the material.
de_000383	a) plastic type A is the most stretchable, b) fix sample more firmly to the table, let it hang for a longer time, stronger weight.
de_000384	a. Plastic type B is the most ductile, then comes D, then C and the least ductile is A. b. Repeat the 1st test several more times and calculate the mean values.      2. have two different people perform the experiment.
de_000385	Not at the table, only at the wall
de_000386	a) Plastics stretch under pressure but not all the same. There must be another reason for the stretching, since they stretch differently in the same test procedure. b) Take the plastic from the same sample and use the same length for all plastics, a longer plastic may stretch more than a shorter one.
de_000387	A. Polymer plastics have different extensibilities when subjected to mechanical force. b. The student should have provided information on the weights used in KG and represented the respective figure in the graph.
de_000388	for me I would use less weight or different weights, also a little more time for the weights.
de_000389	the time they use the weights, and try different weights.
de_000390	Try more time using the weights and try different types of weights.
de_000391	I would try with the time they use the weights and try different weights.
de_000392	For this experiment you must have several weights
de_000393	The plastic could let hang by a hook. The plastics could stay in water for e.g. 5 min. first.
de_000394	a. there are inaccuracies b. use the same size plastic samples in both runs stopwatch to measure five minutes
de_000395	in which he has a rod that has a polymer cord
de_000396	Calculate the different times in this experiment
de_000397	Try different weights and allow more time to try the new method.
de_000398	It can be made with different weights and extension times
de_000399	Run several samples in parallel to obtain more accurate results. All specimens must have the same dimensions
de_000400	estimate whether the porosity of the material has changed estimate whether the hardness of each material has changed draw conclusions
de_000401	The ductility of the tested plastics is different.   The samples should have been tested simultaneously.
de_000402	In three specimens, the elongation was different in the first and second pass. Improvement: - Do not glue the plastic specimen to the edge of the table, but fix it to a clamp - Determine the result in a smaller measuring unit.
de_000403	B stretches the most A the least certain weights use other fastening of the plastic
de_000404	The accuracy does not seem to be very meaningful yet. The experiment would have had to be done a few more times to get a good average value to be able to determine the ductility more precisely. Currently, the values vary a lot, even though the same material was loaded twice with the same weight for the same duration. Better fixation of the specimens on the table, because glue could influence the ductility. Also, more runs to determine ductility more accurately - check that clamps do not squeeze plastic or prevent it from stretching.
de_000405	a.) he did not have the same basic conditions probably the weight was divergent b.) 1 measure exactly how heavy the mass was 2 hang up on a spring balance (plastic + mass)
de_000406	ka
de_000407	a) Plastic A and B can be stretched more and more. Plastic C less and less and D not at all. b) Further test runs.
de_000408	a) Different plastics show different expansion behavior. b) More precise information on how to bond (spot, flat, etc.) b) Use a caliper gauge to determine the lengths more precisely (with decimal place).
de_000409	Take a plastic sample, measure the length, tape a corner of it to a table and hang weights on it with a clamp. After 5 minutes, measure the length again. Perform the procedure for all samples and then perform a 2nd run.
de_000410	a. Either the plastic used is not the same for each experiment, or the weights were different. b. The data at the end should describe exactly which plastic was used for which run and which weights were used.
de_000411	a. the plastic is already more stretched from the start, i.e. longer, in the second attempt and is therefore stretched more in the second attempt b. 1. he should use new pieces of plastic in the 2nd attempt 2. I can think of no suggestion for improvement
de_000412	a) Plastic A would be stretched the least, B the most, C shortened at the second measurement, D stretched but remained constant between D1 and D2 b) Vise instead of gluing to the table, initial length of the plastics should be the same, standardized places for fixing the weight clamps
de_000413	Could put the polymer into the press and press to tear and thus compare the strength of the polymer
de_000414	Tape the top corner of the plastic specimen to a uniformly horizontal place and let the weight hang on the clamp for more than 5 minutes.
de_000415	D. has neither stretched nor elongated. With a heavy clamp, and with different material, the experiment would have turned out differently.
de_000416	the whole material succumbed to changes and extended except d It is possible to heat materials to a certain temperature You can cool materials to a certain temperature This will give an understanding of how things can happen in different climates
de_000417	a. The LA polymer has greater physical-mechanical properties b.It would improve the results to distinguish between natural polymers and systemic polymers
de_000418	Not all elites are stretched. stretched elites are not stretched by the same percentage To improve, there are two approaches, is not enough, and it is worth trying 4 for more reliable results.
de_000419	Increase the number of passes for each material,increase the time under a small weight
de_000420	conclusion: Not all polymers respond to stretching in the same way. -The student could have made sure that all samples were the same length. he should also have tested stretching with different weights. -The experiment should also be done for all samples at the same temperature because the stretching is not the same when the temperature changes.
de_000421	retractable tripod and micrometer
de_000422	There is a normal development in the experiment
de_000423	Perform a second pass (D2) that runs exactly like the first pass (D1).
de_000424	1 : Classification based on polymer structure 2 : Backbone structures of some important organic heterochain polymers 3 : Important addition polymers derived from ethylene.
de_000425	you could have included another type of plastic in the sample collection to increase validity
de_000426	a. The first plastic is the most unstable, B he/she has extended, but C has contracted and plastic that D has not extended, in smaller measure, he/she has remained the same. b. The experimental configuration that could have measured the volume of the plastics, and also its capacity of absorption.
de_000427	a.a plastic sample became longer b.you need to specify the mass of the sample, Hang weights on the clamp and let it hang for 15 minutes
de_000428	"Its function is to increase the performance of the bitumen This increases, for example, the tolerance to temperature and cold The performance of the bitumen is expressed as """"Performace Grade"""" and is often the pre-addition of polymer PG64-10 Ie it is able to maintain the temperature up to 64 and the lowest -10 When polymer is added, it becomes PG70-16 That is, its efficiency increased to 70 degrees Celsius The question arises: what if the bitumen PG64-10 and the asphalt temperature 70 or above -10?  If the temperature exceeds 64, the asphalt layer will be soft and if loads are exceeded, it will not be known In contrast, if the temperature reaches more than -10, the bitumen will solidify and cracks will begin on the surface of the asphalt concrete"
de_000429	A good methods section describes what you did in the lab in a way that is easy to understand and detailed enough to be repeated. Follow the guidelines below to improve your methods:  If your methods are not easy to follow, you can ask someone to read it. Ask him or her to identify places in the procedure that are not clear, and then revise those places for more clarity. It may be more helpful to include words that help the reader follow the process of the experiment: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3; first, then, finally; first second third; after, next, later, following; etc. If your method is difficult to follow because it is long and complicated, consider breaking it down into separate parts, each with a subheading. You can divide it into the typical parts of an experimental procedure (such as lab setup, lab procedures, and data analysis) or, if there were multiple experiments, a part for each experimental procedure. If you need to add more detail to your methods, go back to the Lab Manual and the notes you or a lab partner took during the procedure and use them to remind yourself of what you did in the lab
de_000430	Plastics A and B stretch without returning to the original shape, plastics C and B expand or return to the original length. It is necessary to study the dependence of the length of the plastic on the magnitude of the load, change the load or increase the number of experiments
de_000431	Plastic A has the greatest extensibility, Plastic C has decreased, Plastic D has not increased The student should repeat and take the average Use the same weights for each plastic to make the experiment fair
de_000432	Plastic should be hung on a harness instead of a table. Gravity should be taken into account when calculating the results.
de_000433	A) The degree of ductility in the second pass was even greater than the first. B) 1)Weigh the goods on electronic scales; 2)Fix loads in the same place.
de_000434	a-D2 expands more than D1 b-Use the same masses for each plastic hang the masses on each plastic simultaneously
de_000435	it seems that the first resin is the most elastic.  To improve the results, you should also try which is more resistant and which is less expensive
de_000436	I do not know how the results change
de_000437	a. The conclusion is that the sample of polymer b is the most widespread, that is, He has the greatest extensibility. b. The experiment should be conducted at a different temperature, lower than and higher than room temperature
de_000438	A is the most extensible. C is the measurement error, repeat C.
de_000439	a. The first two stretched samples have increased b.next two sample has remained almost the same The experiment should be conducted within four walls, so that it is no longer different from gas D.use different kinds of plastic, so it may have different results
de_000440	a. Plastic art -/+ 20% b. Mass plastic type Temperature
de_000441	The dates vary because there are no specific dates for each test. Place a time value on each with different intervals. Note and measure the minutes of each.
de_000442	Plastic types A + B have become longer. Platic type D has remained the same. And card C has become shorter, that seems unlikely. The test should be performed again with heavier weights. The weights must also stay longer than five minutes.
de_000443	Different types of plastic can be stretched in different ways. The test setup lacks information on the mass acting on the plastic and it is not clear whether D2 is about previously unstretched plastic specimens.
de_000444	a: the plastic materials stretched according to the total length b1: a notation of the mass of the weight, b2: a length indication of the plastic pieces
de_000445	a. Plastic type A is the most stretchable, B stretches only minimally, C even contracts and D stably retains its shape. b. I am missing the original length (i.e. before D1) and a third run to determine, for example, whether plastic type D really does not stretch at all or only minimally.
de_000446	to a: A sample is taken and then measured. The resulting different specimen lengths make it difficult to compare the measurements. The differences between the D1 and D2 measurements are thus amplified. to b: Predefined specimen length and weights Do not glue specimens firmly, but clamp them. This prevents falsification of the results due to the properties of the adhesive used.
de_000447	a) Sample D has the same results b) The length with which the Pr Pr is started must be taken into account.
de_000448	Plastic type A has the least extensibility, B the most, C is not further stretched in test D2 but compressed (measurement error?), D has the highest extensibility but is maximally stretched after the D1 test and test D2 has no more influence on the material.  Improvements: Cutting the specimens to exactly the same length beforehand, optimized attachment of the specimen and the weight to the specimen, definition of the mass of the weights, same temperature of the specimens.
de_000449	Do not glue the plastic, but attach it immediately to a rack with a hook. Do not remove the weight before measuring.
de_000450	a. the plastic parts react differently to the weights. b. All plastic parts would have to be the same length to get a more accurate result. Or you can do the test more times and calculate the average at the end, so you also have a more accurate result.
de_000451	"Plastic result """"c"""" invalid 1)Leave it more time with the weights. 2)Don't leave out the length."
de_000452	I think they took different weights, so the data was distorted. One could have taken uniform, which is not explained in the example. Otherwise, unfortunately, I can not think of any more possibilities.
de_000453	After removing the weights, leave the samples for about 5 minutes to 10 minutes and then measure the results. Leave the weights on the sample for 10 to 15 minutes.
de_000454	a) Plastic A is the most ductile, plastic C will eventually tear b) Fixed stationary structure of all test materials with attached length scale
de_000455	You should tabulate each weight and compare them to each material so you know which is more resistant
de_000456	You could tabulate the weights hanging for each plastic and see their proportion according to the material used as plastic
de_000457	a. Plastic type A has the strongest ductility, while plastic type D has the worst (no measurable difference). The student seems to have made a mistake with plastic type C. b.-He should make sure that the plastic pieces have the same thickness or width, at least among your individual plastic types. -He should perform the experiment at least three times and calculate the mean value from the individual differences in length.
de_000458	- is the plastic reused in the second pass (D2)?
de_000459	My conclusion is that plastic types A and B become more ductile if they have already been stretched once, while plastic type C becomes less ductile and plastic type D remains the same. To improve the experimental setup, one should have checked more carefully whether the plastic has not been stretched before. And perhaps also compare pre-stretched with unstretched of the same type side by side?
de_000460	It can be seen in the individual values that there were small deviations between the two runs, except for the fourth plastic. Here, an average value could be calculated to obtain a reasonably useful result. However, plastic A stretched the least, plastic D the most. Plastic A would therefore have the highest strength, plastic D the lowest. For a more accurate result, more runs would have had to be made or a tensile test would have had to be performed to determine the ductility.
de_000461	a. According to statistics, the length of the plastic lengthens already after 5 minutes, depending on the type between 0-2 mm. b. Tie a rope to the clamp instead of weights, then pull this full force, or attach to a tension lock device and keep tightened.
de_000462	Soft plastic expands due to weight, plastic type D is probably very hard.
de_000463	a) plastic type B is the most ductile b) use different weights; use the same (not new) specimens for the runs
de_000464	a. The measurements are either distorted or there is another factor that leads to different results. b. At what distance from the bottom edge is the clamp being stressed? How are the weights removed so that there is no further energy applied to the plastic?
de_000465	how many weights are attached? which plasicates are used?
de_000466	The initial situation was not the same, because results were different. Different weights could have been used. Then one could see but which weight, which plastic shows a reaction It could have been varied in the hanging time to see how long it takes for a plastic to react to the weight
de_000467	You may be interested in the initial value.
de_000468	better polymer plastic samples, Repeat the procedure for the remaining three plastic samples.
de_000469	Plastics A, B and C stretched differently. He could have taken weights of different weights and performed several tests.
de_000470	- To improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experience (at least three) and evaluate the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity. - According to the data obtained in the experiment, sample A has greater extensibility and sample C has retractable properties.
de_000471	a) The elongation of the plastic does not only depend on the tensile weight b) Make sure that the lengths of the specimens are equal Make sure that the environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) are equal
de_000472	The denser the smaller material, the more stretchable
de_000473	"The passes were not made exactly, otherwise the results would be the same. Correct attachment to the table (not gluing). Direct measurement """"on the table""""."
de_000474	material temperature ambient temperature
de_000475	"Plastic type D has stretched by the same value and is therefore constant. However, you should make at least 8 more passes for precision/accuracy. Plastic type B is the """"softest"""" because it has stretched the most. Plastic type A is """"hardest"""" -> least stretching."
de_000476	Plastic type B and D are the most stretchable. A and C, on the other hand, are not. The validity of the results could be improved by measuring more frequently than just 2 times.
de_000477	he should use new plastic samples. he could have used some kind of lathe for the test.
de_000478	The plastic was stretched. Test setup can be improved with the weight.
de_000479	While plastic types A and B have increased in length, C has actually decreased and D has remained the same. The test could be repeated by pulling the plastic threads at both ends and measuring how much force is needed to break them. Repeat this several times to find the limit.
de_000480	Conclusion: different elongation depending on the material used, B and D and A and C are quite similar.    Weight should be defined to ensure that it is the same The plastics should have the same length
de_000481	Let it hang longer. Stretch once more.
de_000482	Temperature of the plastic more accurate measuring instruments
de_000483	In the 2nd run take new plastic, take equal weights
de_000484	the plastic increased its length. Let it hang more than five minutes. they could use different weights.
de_000485	you measure how the plastic deforms under the pull of gravity. you measure the length at the beginning and at the end.
de_000486	Plastic types B and D are significantly more stretchable compared to plastic types A and C.  The experiment could be improved if it were indicated how long the weights hung on the plastic types and how heavy they were.  In addition, an attempt could be made to stretch to the breaking point.
de_000487	a) all polymer plastics are stretched except sample C b) 1.he should have used several polyplastics of the same type and put them next to each other and then compare the results with each other 2.he should have also used double weights and then see if they are also doubly stretched
de_000488	a. The stretching of the plastic types increases only minimally in the second run with the same waiting time b. Stronger adhesive for fastening the plastic or other fastening method such as a screw.
de_000489	A. No conclusion possible because the respective initial length of the plastics was not specified B. Specification of the respective initial length of the plastics. Indication of the percentage stretching of the respective plastics.
de_000490	To improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experiences (at least three) and evaluate the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity. According to the data obtained in the experiment, sample A has greater extensibility and sample C has retractable properties.
de_000491	a) After testing the ductility of 4 different polymer plastics, three of the four plastics tested showed deformation, plastic A was stretched by 2 mm, plastic B was stretched by 1 mm, plastic C was compressed by 1 mm and plastic D was neither stretched nor compressed. b) Method 1: Instead of gluing the plastic sample to the corner of the table, it would have been better to use a vice.  Method 2: Use plastic pieces of the same size to obtain a better validation.
de_000492	Follow the prescription that researchers give you is important for effectiveness
de_000493	- According to the data obtained in the experiment, sample A has greater extensibility and sample C has retractable properties.  - To improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experiences (at least three) and evaluate the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity.
de_000494	a. There are polymers that can be stretched by weight and there are polymers that are more stable. b. 1. the spring length of the polymer 2. the type of polymer
de_000495	.
de_000496	what type of plastic, what weights
de_000497	a. Conclusion : Polymer plastics A,B have expanded, D has not changed and plastic C has shrunk.
de_000498	by how much did the glue give way how big did the hole become how heavy were the weights
de_000499	a) You can see that the same material is stretched differently b) Hard to say how he could have improved the results...maybe the measurement concept is not 100% logical and you could have presented it differently
de_000500	Follow the prescription that researchers give you is important for effectiveness
de_000501	- Which plastics were used - If a plastic is longer, it is also easier to pull it apart - Length of the unstretched plastic
de_000502	a) Deformability: D>B>C>A b) Perform the test 3 times exactly the same and calculate the mean value, also clamp the upper corner, do not glue it, vary the time.
de_000503	No indication of the length of the plastic part. Plastic parts of the same length would be more suitable for comparison. Alternatively, a percentage specification of the elongation as a result would make more sense. Instead of the NAmen ABC, it would be relevant for a result consideration which plastics are involved.
de_000504	"Plastic type B is the most ductile, followed by D, C and A. Possibilities for improvement: 1. the experiment could have been carried out with different """"hanging times"""". 2. the experiment could have been carried out with different weights."
de_000505	The more runs, the more accurate the mean - more measurements More accurate conditions (which weights? Always at the exact same place? Timing with stopwatch?)
de_000506	He could have waited a longer time. In addition, he could have possibly run more than two series of tests to consolidate the result.
de_000507	Conclusion: A and B wear out, while C and D remain the same or even harden. Improvements: Digital monitoring of the process; parallel comparison setups for better analogy.
de_000508	Answer C has contracted again. Type of plastic.
de_000509	Sample A shows greater extensibility and sample C shows retractable properties.  More replicates are needed to improve the validity of the results
de_000510	- According to the data obtained in the experiment, sample A has greater extensibility and sample C has retractable properties.   - To improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experience and evaluate the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity.
de_000511	once a material has been stretched, it can only be stretched by a fraction of its original length. this can be improved by adding different weights and more passes.
de_000512	a) Plastic type B stretches the most, plastic type D the second most, plastic type C the third most and plastic type A the least (at least in absolute terms, for the percentage comparison equal lengths of all plastic types would have to be ensured beforehand). For plastic type A, the deviation between the runs is also highest, for plastic types B and C it is lower and plastic type D seems to be stretched equally in both runs. b) Ensure a constant temperature within the test set-up (possible influence of heat on stretching behavior); equal length of all plastic types at the beginning of the test.
de_000513	More attempts= better result.
de_000514	Plastics A and C are not as ductile as B and D.  More than two measurements should be made to determine if the results are significant by the standard deviation. Use different weights for several series of measurements.
de_000515	Follow the prescription that researchers give you is important for effectiveness
de_000516	Plastic A, B and D stretch the same or more on the 2nd attempt. Only C stretches less.  He should not glue the specimens to the table but attach them with a firm connection that remains constant.
de_000517	- The student demonstrates the variation of different polymers.
de_000518	it can be concluded that material A is the one that has greater ductility of the materials studied, and material C is the one that has less ductility. You can even talk about a sinkable effect.  The study can be improved, including data on the effect of temperature and humidity on the materials to be used. Other materials can be added.
de_000519	Sample A is the most expandable and Sample C is retractable.  You can vary the environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity to see how they affect the results.
de_000520	Sample A is the most extensible of the four polymer resins. Specimen C is retractable.  Different material thicknesses can be evaluated Different environmental conditions of heat and humidity can be evaluated.
de_000521	try to improve the performance
de_000522	"a. Plastics a and b are not elastic enough and ""wear out"". Plastic C is exactly the opposite or he has probably measured himself here. Plastic D is of high quality and will not wear out from the weight. b. With more identical samples (e.g. 4x C), you can form an average value in order to reduce measurement errors or exclude production errors.  You can also perform the test with several weights."
de_000523	a) There are plastics that expand under weight. There are plastics that shorten under weight and there are plastics whose weight does not expand under load. b) Extend the load by the weight - i.e. 10 minutes instead of only 5. Hang plastic samples next to each other and record the different results in the photo.
de_000524	good possibility of comparison instead of a weight attach a metal spring to the bottom and draw to the plastic sample take different sizes of the sample
de_000525	Plastic type A is the most flexible. All plastic types should be the same length to begin with. It would be better not to attach them to the table so that they hang around the corner, but to attach them to the wall, for example, where they can hang straight down.
de_000526	Conclusion: plastic type A shows the highest variability between the two runs, B the lowest.  Areas for improvement: Detection of room temperature, detection of humidity.
de_000527	The results differ in three out of four cases. The question is whether this is due to measurement inaccuracy or sample deviations.  More accurate measurement Ensure uniformity of samples
de_000528	It has almost come to the same result. Could have taken different quantities to achieve a different result.
de_000529	The behavior of the materials is different: some stretch, the longer you stretch, the more, some stretch less, some stretch the same distance per unit of time.  He could have investigated the same experimental set-up with weights of different weights - and thus found out whether, for example, one of the plastics cracks if the weight is too heavy.  He could have cooled or heated the plastics beforehand to see if their properties changed as a result.
de_000530	Results are identical, differences are tolerances or measurement errors.  It is not clear from the instructions whether the samples were of the same length. He could make several runs with different weights or durations.
de_000531	a) Plastic type A and B have become longer (A by 2 mm and B by 1 mm), plastic type C has become shorter by 1 mm, plastic type D has remained the same b) ???
de_000532	different types of plastic -are stretched with weight -then their lengths are measured before and after
de_000533	a. Polymer A has undergone the greatest change in shape, Polymer D has remained apparently unchanged, and Samples B and C have shown minimal change. b. The test results are not significant. He could have used longer specimens to obtain more meaningful results and used a modified fixture that would allow the expansion of the materials under weight to be determined.
de_000534	a) Although it was the same procedure, the two results differ. b) 1. measure the time accurately (was a stopwatch used?) 2. avoid parallax?
de_000535	more heat hot cold fast alternate
de_000536	A) in relation to D1, D2 had a greater exact strain in sample C where the result had a lower strain than the other samples.  B) 1. I think it could be improved by collecting a third sample to compare it with the other 2 results and check the quality of both.  2. apply more minutes when the samples hang, instead of 5 minutes, try 10 minutes both samples.
de_000537	The plastics react differently to the stress. Some show greater degradation after additional stress, while others become more resistant. The ambient temperature would have been interesting, as would the thickness of the plastics.
de_000538	a. Only one plastic gives the same result in both runs. It follows that the experimental setup is too inaccurate. b. The fixation could be more stable (e.g. by using a nail instead of glue). The experiment could be carried out with different amounts of time.
de_000539	no idea
de_000540	How heavy are the weights? How thick is the plastic? Are all specimens the same thickness?
de_000541	the plastics behave differently, so that no commonality can be established.  Instead of a chemical adhesive, which manipulates the material properties of the plastic, one should have used a mechanical clamp instead, for example. Furthermore, the experiment should have been carried out with different weights.
de_000542	a) Plastic type B is more extensible than plastic type A b) 1. Report the elongation relative to the length of each specimen as a percentage rather than in millimeters.       2. use more than two passes to improve the statistics of the result.
de_000543	The experiment shows that the samples behave in an unpredictable way.One could have made several more experimental runs and done it with different weights.
de_000544	The data in the table indicate by how much the respective plastics have gained in length after stretching. In order to be able to better compare the stretchability, the initial length of the plastics used and the weights used during stretching should also be indicated in g in the table.
de_000545	a.  Purely based on data, plastic B is most ductile. b. Plastic specimens of the same length (does not come out clearly) Instead of fixing to the table, prefer to use a hook Measure before removing the weights to exclude factor of contraction
de_000546	"a) It shows that the student did not work cleanly enough. In case """"C"""" it happened that the plastic became shorter, which cannot be correct. In fact, in general, it is possible to detect an elongation b) Perform several tests so that one has several results (runs) to determine an average of the elongation."
de_000547	-It is unclear whether D1 was made with the identical plastic specimens of the respective material or with new ones.  If with new ones: Different types of plastic exhibit different degrees of extensibility. The extensibility in the 2nd pass corresponds to the 1st pass only for plastic D, thus only this measurement is reliable and valid. For A, B, C, measurement errors may explain the upward or downward deviations (e.g. time of hanging with weights) or non-identical dimensions/volumes of plastic specimens A, B, C, D and in D1 and D2 or room temperature changes explain the differences between values D1 and D2.  Improvements: Plastic parts must all have the same weight/length, width/volume; keep room temperature constant (measure!), precise measurement of where to place clamps on the plastic.
de_000548	All plastics were stretched. Sample A was stretched the least. Sample B was stretched the most. Improve validity by using different weights to test how they affect stretching.
de_000549	my conclusion that at D1 is reduced and at D2 is not 1- explain a little more clearly 2 - use simpler terms
de_000550	You don't know. Best you take the next answer, here is only garbage.
de_000551	a. Plastic specimens behave differently, they are considered likely to be different plastics b. - Shape and size of specimens must be exactly the same - better method of attachment.
de_000552	He should have taken new samples of the respective type of plastic
de_000553	10 12 22 23 14 13 20 20 Remove the weights Repeat the procedure
de_000554	Most species were stretched, but it is not obvious with which weights were worked. This should be described. Possibly a third attempt in which the time is increased.
de_000555	Plastic B expands the most, followed by plastic D, C and A. How great the load was in each case is not clear from the description.
de_000556	a. On the second run, each plastic was stretched only slightly b. Determining the weight of the weights Equal length of each plastic sample.
de_000557	he should fasten materials better
de_000558	I did not understand that either
de_000559	Conclusion: Every type of plastic except D behaved differently in the 2nd run than in the first. The temperature should have been taken into account and the time of the run.
de_000560	a) Different plastic is stretched to different starts. b) 1. how are the weights attached?      2. what is the mass of the weights?
de_000561	Plastic D has not changed, while B has shrunk.  The plastic should always have the same width Repeat the experiment with different weights
de_000562	more accurate,ok
de_000563	a. I wonder about the different results b. Same size of the samples, weights must weigh exactly the same
de_000564	a: Plastics A, B and C may be thermoplastics. In the case of D, I would say that a thermoset was used. b: The length of 5 minutes could be increased to 1 hour to obtain more accurate results.  To be on the safe side again, a D3 would be useful, then you could form an average value, which then says relatively much.
de_000565	some species expanded even more during the 2nd test attempt than the first time
de_000566	a. It appears that polymer B is the most ductile. b.  The initial length and the cross section of the specimens should be identical
de_000567	Hello, unfortunately this task is not feasible for me,I have always been a niete in chemistry.
de_000568	a) A and B seem to deform more with increasing deformation. D does not change its elasticity with deformation. The reverse is true for C. b) Several tests could have been performed with the same type of plastic and several runs.
de_000569	The extensibility of B is the largest and then D. A is the smallest 1) Use longer specimens 2) More than two carry out.
de_000570	Polymers are high molecular weight compounds whose molecules consist of a large number of repetitive atomic groups linked together by covalent chemical bonds.
de_000571	plastic types A and B became longer on the second run, while plastic type C became shorter, and D remained the same. you could weight the plastic types longer or shorter. the weight could still have been specified
de_000572	The results show: 1. sample A and B have stretched 2. sample C has broken off (could not carry the weight) 3. sample D is very stable and the weight had no influence Improvements: 1. increase weight at A, B and C to experience the maximum stretching 2. decrease weight at C 3. best measure the distances by real time and record them to get a diagram. Or just measure with different weights in a linear distance.
de_000573	plastic type a b and c expand , d is the most stable
de_000574	a) In the second pass it is always a little different from the first, but the result is always similar. b) Larger mass Let it hang for longer time
de_000575	A is the most ductile plastic, while C is the least ductile plastic and even decreases in size.  The experimental setup could be improved by using different weights and different time periods. Perhaps each plastic should also be suspended without weight to have an accurate comparison value.
de_000576	- different plastics are stretched to different degrees under pressure - improvement: specification of temperature or always the same temperature, stretching equally on both sides instead of only on one side
de_000577	the student should specify the weight of the weights and experiment with different weights if necessary
de_000578	The conclusion is not clear for me.  Only 2 of the 4 strips have stretched. One strip has become smaller and one has not changed. Clearer results could be achieved by increasing the weight hanging on the strips or by increasing the time instead of 5 minutes maybe 15 minutes.
de_000579	a.  The material affects the stretchability of the polymer plastic. Depending on what kind of material it is, the plastic will stretch more. b. Hang the weight centrally on the plastic pipe and not on a corner.  Saw all plastic pipes to the initial length, as it does not say here whether they are all the same length.
de_000580	a. - Experiment on plastic type A should be repeated as a very high deviation of 20% was obtained.      - Plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A the least b. - Indicate length of plastic pieces before and after.      - Indicate mass of weights.
de_000581	a) The measurement data deviate only slightly from each other, which suggests that the experiment is well reproducible. b) To generate meaningful results, all samples should have the same shape and length. Statistically, an estimate of the measurement accuracy can only be made with 3 data sets.
de_000582	Polymer B is the most ductile. This is followed by B, C, and A. The validity of the results would have been higher if a larger number of runs had been performed.
de_000583	Without initial length data, it can only be concluded that all plastics stretch. The use of a uniform length would improve the experimental setup. Alternatively, the percentage change could be given.
de_000584	A) Plastic D did not expand under the weight used. Plastic C has strangely shortened. Plastic A and B have expanded as expected. B) Not only the same length but also the same thickness of the plastics must be taken into account. In addition, it would be necessary to specify exactly which weight is used.
de_000585	a) If I assume that all the plastic samples had the same shape at the beginning (same length, width, and thickness), then plastics B and D are more ductile than A and C. b) The student could have given the original length, width, and thickness of the samples and the mass of the weights. The student could have repeated the experiment at different temperatures.
de_000586	a) In general, plastic does not change too much. b) Use different weights and different times to see how much plastic can change.
de_000587	Identical length of plastic pieces Identical weights that are attached
de_000588	a) The only possible conclusion is that the materials actually stretch. A comparison between the specimens is not possible, since only length changes (in mm), but not strains (unitless) were recorded. b) Recording of the initial lengths and corresponding calculation of the strains // Recording of the mass of the weights/clamps and corresponding calculation of the force exerted // Further values necessary depending on the objective of the experiment.
de_000589	Plastic type A is most stretchable, C contracts with weight. Improvement: Include different weights in the evaluation, perform more than 2 runs.
de_000590	a.) The variation of the same type of plastic in different runs is very small, so it seems likely that different materials can be stretched differently. b.) The student could have additionally measured the weight of the plastic sample and indicated the weight of the attached weights
de_000591	Three of the four types of plastic stretch under the influence of weights - hang several different weights on the same type of plastic ,but different pieces - use several times than just 5min
de_000592	a) Plastic type B has stretched the farthest in absolute terms. b) Even more runs, measure stretch more often.
de_000593	A) different types of plastic have different lengths/extensibilities B) initial length and final length measure weights of different weights
de_000594	For the experiment , take plastic of equal length and determine the size of GewiChef.
de_000595	What is the minimum length of the material at the exit? How much weight is hanging on the film? How much material should protrude over the edge of the table?
de_000596	a) The differences between D1 and D2 are small b) Increase or decrease the room temperature Change the time the weights hang on it
de_000597	a. Of the four plastic specimens tested, specimen B has elongated by the greatest amount due to stretching. b. 1. It is important to state the actual length at the beginning and at the end in order to be able to make statements about the relative/percentage elongation, and thus about the stretchability of the materials and not just the elongation of the specimens tested. 2. the two runs should be performed under the same conditions (temperature, air pressure, humidity, weights!!!). If this is not possible, the respective conditions must be documented and presented together with the results.
de_000598	a. Plastic type A stretches the most (not only the biggest difference, also in percentage. D is the only type that does not change. b. Changing the test time (1. 5 min, 2. 10min, 3. 15 min); Same length of sample (also same length free hanging).
de_000599	a) Different plastics are flexible in different ways. b) The weights should be the same for each plastic and preferably also fixed. The plastic samples should otherwise be comparable? (Same thickness/width) It is not clear whether D2 runs with the same plastic pieces or others of the same type
de_000600	A,c,d,b describes the sorting according to extensibility. Validity can be increased by: same volume of specimens , same weights
de_000601	A. A and B are warped, C has contracted and D has remained the same length.  B. He should have tested several times, also better describe with how much force was pulled.
de_000602	Different types of plastic stretch to different degrees. One could make more passes and standardize the initial length of the samples.
