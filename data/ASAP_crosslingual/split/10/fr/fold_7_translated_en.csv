5,5,fr_100006,"Black::A black dog or cat's eyes are less likely to stand out than their light coated counterparts. When surrounded by dark fur, their facial expressions are less pronounced and therefore more difficult for adopters to read. In many cultures, the color black is associated with evil, misfortune and bad luck.",10,0
78,78,fr_100079,Dark gray::The color can offer more comfort by controlling the temperature well.,10,0
94,94,fr_100095,"White::I would say choosing the white color would keep the dog house cooler based on the example experiment.  The darker the color, the more heat energy is absorbed, so using white makes sense if you want to have a cooler temperature.",10,1
100,100,fr_100101,"White::The lighter color absorbs less heat, because it is a house with a closed space, it is ideal for the temperature to be comfortable. The white color varies very little between tests, while the other colors reached higher degrees.",10,1
101,101,fr_100102,Light gray::The light gray cover is what determines a lower temperature rise in the kennel compared to the covers of other colors.,10,1
104,104,fr_100105,"White::Painting the doghouse white can lower the temperature inside the doghouse, Because white had the lowest average temperature in the experiment (_42).",10,2
122,122,fr_100123,White::A dog would die if the temperature was too high. That's why I chose white. A lower temperature is better.,10,0
123,123,fr_100124,"White::By using white, the interior of the dog house will have the lowest possible temperature in all situations, this can be proven by using the table provided as a basis, where white had the lowest temperature of all the colors used in the experiment.",10,2
129,129,fr_100130,"White::White reflects light better than dark colors, so lower the temperature",10,1
132,132,fr_100133,"White::According to the experiments, white is the most suitable because it generates a smaller variation of temperature inside the container in contact with the light and thus would allow a more airy place for the making of the animal's home.",10,1

145,145,fr_100146,White::the white color is a color that is not suitable because it gets dirty quickly the ideal is a darker color.,10,0
152,152,fr_100153,"White::This color can affect the interior of the kennel by making it cooler in the summer months.  In the winter, you would want a darker color to raise the temperature to warm the dog.",10,1

194,194,fr_100195,White::White absorbs moisture and affects the interior of the doghouse.,10,1
207,207,fr_100208,White::The effect of white color is weak compared to other colors. It only passes the least amount of heat into the object. So white is the best choice to paint the niche according to the results.,10,2
