As we can see in the experiment, the white color was the one that kept the lowest air temperature inside the pot, which is why it should be used in the niche.",10,2
1,117,117,fr_100118,"White: Since the temperature in the bottle is the lowest (_42 degrees on average), it is that the white color allows to absorb a minimum of heat, therefore to return a minimum of it",10,2
2,102,102,fr_100103,"Black: The darker the color of the cover, the greater the increase in the air temperature in the glass bottle, as the darker colors absorb more energy.",10,2

10,89,89,fr_100090,White: The white color will not absorb any energy from the environment and will make the niche less hot. It has been shown that white absorbs less heat.,10,1
