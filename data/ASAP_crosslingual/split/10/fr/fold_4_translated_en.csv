110,110,fr_100111,"White::According to the results of the experiment, we opted for the color of White paint, in fact because inside the kennel that Brandi and Jerry want to design the temperature will be less important because it is a color of paint less dark, so opting for the white color will allow them to design a kennel that absorbs a lesser amount of heat inside the kennel compared to a dark color for example the black color for the kennel that on the contrary will absorb a significant amount of heat.",10,2
133,133,fr_100134,White::The white color allows to limit the heating of the interior of the kennel in case of sunlight. A darker color would have generated an important increase in temperature.,10,1

We can see from the chart that after 10 minutes, the color white increases the temperature of the interior of the doghouse in this range. This suggests that the energy absorption is uniform - neither too low nor too high.",10,2
