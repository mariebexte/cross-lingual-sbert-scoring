0,110,110,fr_100111,"White: Based on the results of the experiment, we opted for the white paint color, in fact because inside the niche that Brandi and Jerry want to design the temperature will be less important because it is a less dark paint color, so opting for the white color will allow them to design a niche that absorbs a less significant amount of heat inside the niche compared to a dark color for example the black color for the niche that will instead absorb a significant amount of heat.",10,2
1,181,181,fr_100182,"White: In my opinion, the best temperature would be in the range of _41 to 45 degrees.  We can see on the table that after 10 minutes, the white color increases the temperature inside the niche in that range. This suggests that energy absorption is uniform – neither too low nor too high.",10,2

4,12,12,fr_100013,White: lower temperature due to the brighter color as indicated by the information given,10,1
5,133,133,fr_100134,White: The white color limits the warming of the interior of the niche in case of sun. A darker color would have caused an unwanted temperature rise too much.,10,1

8,79,79,fr_100080,White: The niche will heat less in white because this color absorbs less energy,10,1
