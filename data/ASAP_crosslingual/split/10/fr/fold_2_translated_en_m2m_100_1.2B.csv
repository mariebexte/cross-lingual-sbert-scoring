0,96,96,fr_100097,White: The interior of the niche will be less cold than with any other color as white reflects more light than others,10,2
1,172,172,fr_100173,White: White makes the indoor temperature cooler. It only makes _42C versus 53C for black,10,2
2,153,153,fr_100154,"and black: 1. Put the black cover with the thermometer attached to the glass bottle.  2nd Ensure that the starting temperature inside the pot is 24°C. Place the lamp 5 centimeters from the cover and turn on the lamp.  4 is After 10 minutes, measure the air temperature inside the glass bottle and record it as a test 1.  5 is Turn off the lamp and wait for the air in the bottle to return to the starting temperature.  6 is Repeat steps 2 to 5 for trials 2 and 3.  7 is Repeat steps 1 to 6 for dark grey, light grey and white coverings.  8 is Calculate and record the average air temperature for each cover color Data",10,2
3,195,195,fr_100196,"White: I chose white for the niche paint color because, as the data shows, white remains the coolest temperature. This is because white reflects the heat from the sun instead of absorbing it.",10,1
