0,161,161,fr_100162,"White: White has the lowest average temperature. You don’t want a niche to be too hot and with the white color, it’s not too hot.",10,2
1,54,54,fr_100055,"White: This will help the interior of the niche to be cooler. This can be seen in the experiment where after testing with the lighter colored covers, the average temperatures are cooler while the darker temperatures are warmer.",10,2
2,56,56,fr_100057,White: White is a light color so it absorbs less heat ensuring a much more hospitable environment in terms of temperature as demonstrated by the experiment.,10,2
3,130,130,fr_100131,"Black: Black is the best color to use for the niche because the dark color tends to produce a higher or warmer temperature that is in turn good and favourable to the dog’s habitation, because with the increase in the air temperature produced by the dark color cover on the experiment, the dog is assured to be kept warm and in good weather against the cold in his home or home.",10,1
4,28,28,fr_100029,"Black: The black color can be ideal for a dog that has a shorter fur in a cold environment, because the darker the color, the more heat it absorbs, making the environment warmer.",10,1
5,67,67,fr_100068,White: Use white or light color paint on your niche if you live in a hot climate. White and other bright colors will reflect the sun and help keep your dog cool.,10,1
6,60,60,fr_100061,White: White will have the least effect.,10,1
7,75,75,fr_100076,"White: The white color would make the niche more fresh. In the experiment, we can see that white resulted in lower temperatures. It would be good if the dog was not hot.",10,1
8,114,114,fr_100115,White: The results of the experiment are in accordance with the hypothesis of the students. Black warms the air the most and white the least. The same results are visible in the table.,10,1
9,150,150,fr_100151,White: This will make the interior of the niche cooler.,10,1
10,19,19,fr_100020,"Dark grey: In cold climates, darker colors will absorb the heat from the sun and keep the niche warmer inside. Bright colors are suitable for hot climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the interior of the house cooler.",10,1
11,166,166,fr_100167,"White: Because if the niche has to stay under the sun, it will stay cooler",10,1
12,44,44,fr_100045,Black: This color affects the temperature. This is a color that affects more.,10,0
13,21,21,fr_100022,Black::T_1 - D 20 This was a good response so helpful to this question,10,0
14,88,88,fr_100089,"Materialize the space and dare the total look. ... by And for this, nothing better than painting the steps or counter marks so... This method can take some time to be assimilated by your dog but, in the end it turns out to be useful in many...",10,0
15,112,112,fr_100113,Light grey::if possible can reduce the steps of the procedure..I thought that if we increase the temperature to get the result soon..keep this experiment in the vacuum.,10,0
16,147,147,fr_100148,White: White is a beautiful interior color.,10,0
17,50,50,fr_100051,White: that the air in the bottle returns to the average starting air temperature for each cover color,10,0
18,115,115,fr_100116,"White:Give accurate, consistent, and reliable information from Big Data,Support the success of your Big Data projects with Data Intelligence that focuses on Data Integration, Governance and Data Security.,Integrate, govern and secure the data your business needs to succeed with a Data Lake,Integrate, govern and secure the Big Data your business needs to rapidly grow business value",10,0
