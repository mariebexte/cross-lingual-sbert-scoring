0,85,85,fr_100086,White: The effect of white is less than other colors. It only allows a small amount of heat to pass through the object. White is therefore the best choice to paint according to the results.,10,2
1,57,57,fr_100058,"White: With a pot with a white cover, the average temperature inside the bottle is _42Â°C, which is 3 degrees lower than with a light grey cover and 11 degrees lower than with a light cover. Experience shows that the temperature of a closed space is directly correlated with the color of the surface exposed to the heat source: the lighter the roof of the niche, and the less the dog inside will suffer from the heat. It is best to paint the niche in white.",10,2
2,119,119,fr_100120,"Light grey: Light grey has one of the lowest air temperatures unlike black and dark grey, which is good because it means fewer risks of niche overheating, especially in summer. Light grey will increase the air temperature in the niche only if the white color was used, which is useful during the winter season, so that the interior of the niche does not get too cold.",10,2
3,189,189,fr_100190,"White: If they choose the white color, the house will be cooler, with less heat. If they choose darker colors, the house will be warmer and in summer days it will be unbearable for the dog to stay inside.",10,1
4,106,106,fr_100107,"White: Since white absorbs less heat, it is a good idea to make white from the dog niche",10,1
5,111,111,fr_100112,Light grey: The interior will remain cooler but not too cold during the hot summer months. It will allow you to keep some heat during the winter months.,10,1
6,63,63,fr_100064,White: The white color will reflect the heat of the sun and will maintain a lower and more comfortable temperature in the niche,10,1
7,0,0,fr_100001,"Black: Black helps increase the air temperature in the niche, as darker colors absorb more energy.",10,1
8,140,140,fr_100141,"White: As the temperature of the white is within the boundary of _40-43 degrees, the less the temperature rises, the more comfortable the dogs will be and will have less heat in the niche.",10,1
9,17,17,fr_100018,Black: Dark colors absorb much more heat than lighter ones because they absorb more light energy. Bright colors reflect more light,10,1
10,90,90,fr_100091,"Black: The darker the color, the higher the temperature to be measured. This feature can be used in case you are trying to have a higher or lower temperature in a certain environment.",10,1
11,179,179,fr_100180,"White: The dark color gives a brighter look. It has enough power to absorb energy, the experience will strongly support dark colors in the time given, so I chose black.",10,1
12,95,95,fr_100096,White: I chose this colour based on the data collected from experience,10,0
13,187,187,fr_100188,White: White will not affect the temperature because it is low,10,0
14,165,165,fr_100166,White: White absorbs moisture and affects the interior.,10,0
15,109,109,fr_100110,Light grey: we can use multiple color paintings.. and also use attractive patterns to make beautiful,10,0
16,118,118,fr_100119,Black: Calculate and record the average air temperature for each cover color Data,10,0
17,97,97,fr_100098,Dark grey: Give the correct information and get the correct details.,10,0
18,62,62,fr_100063,Light Grey: This Color Should Be Very Attractive For Black,10,0
