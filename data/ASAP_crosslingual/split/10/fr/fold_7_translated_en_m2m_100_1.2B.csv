0,104,104,fr_100105,"White: Painting the niche in white can lower the temperature inside the niche, Because white had the lowest average temperature in the experiment (_42).",10,2
1,207,207,fr_100208,White: The effect of white colour is low compared to other colours. It only leads the slightest amount of heat into the object. White is therefore the best choice to paint the niche according to the results.,10,2
2,123,123,fr_100124,"White: Using white, the interior of the niche will have the lowest possible temperature in all situations, this can be demonstrated using the table provided as a base, where white had the lowest temperature among all colors used in the experiment.",10,2
3,129,129,fr_100130,"White: White reflects light better than dark colors, so lower the temperature",10,1
4,194,194,fr_100195,White: White absorbs moisture and affects the interior of the niche.,10,1
5,184,184,fr_100185,"White: After 10 minutes, an authentic white color was the colour that absorbed the least heat.",10,1
6,134,134,fr_100135,White: Black and other dark colors will attract and absorb the heat of the sun to help keep the dog warm.,10,1
7,152,152,fr_100153,"White: This color can affect the interior of the niche by making it cooler during the summer months.  In winter, you would like a darker color to raise the temperature to warm the dog.",10,1
8,132,132,fr_100133,"White: According to experiments, white is most suitable because it generates a smaller temperature variation inside the container in contact with light and would thus allow a more airy place for the animal's home manufacturing.",10,1
9,94,94,fr_100095,"White: I would say that choosing the white color would keep the niche refrigerator based on the example experience.  The darker the color, the more thermal energy is absorbed, so using white makes sense if you want a cooler temperature.",10,1
10,100,100,fr_100101,"White: The lighter color absorbs less heat, because it is a house with a closed space, it is ideal for the temperature to be comfortable. The white color varied very little between the tests, while the other colors reached higher degrees.",10,1
11,101,101,fr_100102,Light grey: The light grey cover is what determines a lower temperature rise in the chenil compared to the covers of other colors.,10,1
12,122,122,fr_100123,A dog would die if the temperature was too high. So I chose the white. A lower temperature is preferable.,10,0
13,209,209,fr_100210,dark grey: very good,10,0
14,78,78,fr_100079,Dark grey: The color can offer greater comfort by well controlling the temperature.,10,0
15,157,157,fr_100158,Black: I like this experience and find a better result. Each student does their best. This table is used to select the best result.,10,0
16,5,5,fr_100006,"Black: The eyes of a black dog or cat are less likely to stand out than those of their light coated counterparts. When surrounded by dark fur, their facial expressions are less pronounced and therefore more difficult to read for adopters. In many cultures, black is associated with evil, misfortune and misfortune.",10,0
17,142,142,fr_100143,White: The dog will be less hot in the niche.,10,0
18,145,145,fr_100146,White: The white color is a color that is not suitable because it dirt quickly the ideal is a darker color.,10,0
