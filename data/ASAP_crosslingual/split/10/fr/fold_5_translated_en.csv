0,0,fr_100001,"Black::The color black helps to increase the air temperature in the niche, because darker colors absorb more energy.",10,1
17,17,fr_100018,Black::Dark colors absorb much more heat than lighter ones because they absorb more light energy. Light colors reflect more light.,10,1
57,57,fr_100058,"White::With a jar with a white lid, the average temperature is _42Â°C inside the jar, which is 3 degrees lower than with a light gray lid and 11 degrees lower than with a clear lid. Experience shows that the temperature of an enclosed space is directly correlated to the color of the surface exposed to the heat source: the lighter the color of the roof of the kennel, the less the dog inside will suffer from the heat. It is therefore preferable to paint the kennel white.",10,2
62,62,fr_100063,Light gray::THIS COLOR SHOULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO THE DARK,10,0
63,63,fr_100064,White::The white color will reflect the heat of the sun and maintain a lower and more comfortable temperature in the kennel,10,1
85,85,fr_100086,White::the effect of white color is less compared to other colors. It only passes a small amount of heat through the object. So white is the best choice to paint based on the results.,10,2
90,90,fr_100091,"Black::the darker the color, the higher the temperature that will be measured. This feature can be used in case you try to have a higher or lower temperature in a certain environment.",10,1
95,95,fr_100096,White::I chose this color based on the data collected from the experiment,10,0
97,97,fr_100098,Dark gray::Give correct information and get correct details.,10,0
106,106,fr_100107,"White::since white absorbs less heat, it is a good idea to make white of the dog house.",10,1
109,109,fr_100110,Light gray::we can use multiple color paints..and also use attractive patterns to make beautiful,10,0
111,111,fr_100112,Light gray::The interior will remain cooler but not too cold during the hot summer months. Will keep some heat during the winter months.,10,1
118,118,fr_100119,Black::Calculate and record the average air temperature for each lid color Data,10,0
119,119,fr_100120,"Light gray::Light gray has one of the lowest air temperatures as opposed to black and dark gray, which is good because it means less chance of overheating the kennel, especially in summer. The light gray will increase the air temperature in the kennel than if the white color was used, which is useful during the winter season, so that the interior of the kennel does not become too cold.",10,2
140,140,fr_100141,"White::As the temperature of white is in the range of _40-43 degrees, the less the temperature rises, the more comfortable and less hot the dogs will be in the doghouse.",10,1
165,165,fr_100166,White::White absorbs moisture and affects the interior.,10,0
179,179,fr_100180,"White::The darker color gives a brighter look. It has enough power to absorb energy, the experiment will strongly support dark colors in the time allowed, so I selected black.",10,1
187,187,fr_100188,White::White color will not affect the temperature because it is low,10,0
189,189,fr_100190,"White::If they choose the white color, the house will be cooler, with less heat. If they choose darker colors, the house will be hotter and on summer days, it will be unbearable for the dog to stay inside.",10,1
