0,91,91,fr_100092,"White: The white cover gave the smallest increase in temperature compared to other colors. Thus, the white paint from the outside of the niche helps to keep the interior cool.",10,2
1,48,48,fr_100049,"White: White can reflect light away from the interior of the structure. Therefore, the interior should be cooler. The graph shows that white was the color that obtained the coolest result.",10,2
2,143,143,fr_100144,"White: White absorbs less energy. This was confirmed by the temperature measurement shown in the table. The white air had an average temperature of _41 degrees, while the other colors had an average temperature above 45 degrees.",10,2

4,125,125,fr_100126,"White: Looking at the experiment, white has the lowest temperature, making it more convenient for a dog niche",10,1
5,22,22,fr_100023,"White: The brighter the color, the lower the temperature. In a temperate climate and depending on the niche exposure, it may be desirable to compensate for the heat of the sun by painting the niche white.",10,1

8,136,136,fr_100137,"Dark grey: In cold climates, darker colors will absorb the heat from the sun and keep the niche warmer inside. Bright colors are suitable for hot climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the interior of the house cooler.",10,1
9,192,192,fr_100193,Black: Color can affect the interior of the niche because it absorbs more heat,10,1
10,86,86,fr_100087,"White: The darker the color, the more heat is retained in the color. The lighter the colour, the colder the temperature.",10,1
11,164,164,fr_100165,Black: Black and other dark colors will attract and absorb the heat of the sun to help keep the dog warm. Use white or light color paint on your niche if you live in a hot climate.,10,1

17,42,42,fr_100043,"Light Grey: So that you donâ€™t have to limit yourself to painting the niche in colors that camouflage dirt, I chose to do the painting with superwashable and antitouch paint.
