19,19,fr_100020,"Dark gray::In cold climates, darker colors will absorb the sun's heat and keep the kennel warmer inside. Light colors are appropriate for warm climates, as they reflect the sun and keep the interior of the home cooler.",10,1
21,21,fr_100022,Black::T_1 - D 20 This was such a useful answer to this question,10,0
28,28,fr_100029,"Black::the black color can be ideal for a dog that has a shorter coat in a cold environment, because the darker the color, the more heat it absorbs, making the environment warmer.",10,1
44,44,fr_100045,Black::This color affected the temperature. this a color that affects more.,10,0
50,50,fr_100051,White::that the air in the jar returns to the average starting air temperature for each lid color Data,10,0
54,54,fr_100055,"White::This will help the interior of the doghouse to be cooler. This can be seen in the experiment where after testing with the lighter colored lids, the average temperatures are cooler while the darker lids the temperature are warmer.",10,2
56,56,fr_100057,White::White is a light color so it absorbs less heat ensuring a much more hospitable environment in terms of temperature as demonstrated by experiment.,10,2

67,67,fr_100068,White::Use white or light colored paint on your kennel if you live in a warm climate. White and other light colors will reflect the sun and help keep your dog cool.,10,1
75,75,fr_100076,"White::white color would make the doghouse cooler. In the experiment, we can see that white resulted in lower temperatures. It would be good for the dog not to be hot",10,1

112,112,fr_100113,Light gray::if possible can reduce the steps of the procedure.. I thought if we increase the temperature get the result soon..keep this experiment under vacuum.,10,0
114,114,fr_100115,"White::The results of the experiment are in agreement with the students' hypothesis. So, the color black warms the air the most and the color white the least. The same results can be seen in the table.",10,1

130,130,fr_100131,"Black::Black color is the best color to use for the dog house because the dark color tends to produce a higher or warmer temperature which in turn is good and conducive to the dog's dwelling, because with the increase in air temperature produced by the dark colored cover on the experiment, the dog is assured of being kept warm and in good weather against the cold in his house or dwelling.",10,1
147,147,fr_100148,White::WHITE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL INNER COLOR.,10,0
150,150,fr_100151,White::It will make the inside of the dog house cooler.,10,1
