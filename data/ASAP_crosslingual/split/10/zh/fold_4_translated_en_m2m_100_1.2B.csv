0,142,142,zh_100143,"White: The lighter the color, the better the heat dissipation, the above experiment, the average temperature continues to drop from black to white.",10,2
1,281,281,zh_100282,"Black: Black can absorb all light waves and there is no reflection, thereby raising the temperature inside the cage.The results showed that black has been exposed to light for 10 minutes at a starting temperature of 24°C after three repetitive experiments.",10,2
2,11,11,zh_100012,"White: The better the heat dissipation when the color is light, the lower the average from black to white.",10,2
3,102,102,zh_100103,White: The temperature is not too high Suitable for dogs Because dogs have thick fur Temperature is too high easy to heat up White average temperature_42° is closer to the daily temperature,10,1
4,206,206,zh_100207,"White: Increased temperature, but slowed temperature is arbitrary – in one experiment, the temperature is measured at the lowest within the same 10 minutes, and the cover for the white experiment.",10,1
5,19,19,zh_100020,Dark grey: It makes the entire cage appear very dark inside but it is stable Temperature changes rarely after 10 minutes Three but the most stable experimental temperature remains at 48°C,10,1
6,181,181,zh_100182,"White: The lighter the color, the smaller the temperature increase, the deeper the color, the greater the temperature increase.",10,1
7,171,171,zh_100172,White: The temperature inside the cage is the lowest after 10 minutes and the lowest temperature compared to other colors.,10,1
8,81,81,zh_100082,"White: The temperature in the cage will rise as the lighting time increases, but the white temperature is relatively low compared to the other four colours.Suitable for dogs.",10,1
9,239,239,zh_100240,"Black: Higher air temperature, highest average temperature",10,1
10,98,98,zh_100099,"Black: Increase the temperature inside the cage to keep it warm to measure the temperature inside the cage, and again to measure the temperature increase after painting black.",10,1
11,50,50,zh_100051,Dark grey: makes the temperature inside the dog cage more than stable and temperate when exposed to sunlight The temperature is suitable and suitable The dog's biosynthesis tends to be smooth,10,1
12,180,180,zh_100181,Dark grey: This color makes the temperature reach_a fixed value suitable for puppy residence Deep grey experiment1-3 temperature is 48°C,10,0
13,68,68,zh_100069,"Dark grey: the deeper the color, the greater the impact",10,0
14,218,218,zh_100219,"Light grey: the known starting temperature is 24 ° C, it is known that at this time the weather is cooler and comfortable, the choice of the middle two colors are moderate, although the night is cooler but the temperature is longer, so it is still cool and light grey.",10,0
15,215,215,zh_100216,Dark grey: remained in the dog cage for a relatively long period of time - remained unchanged after a small increase in temperature,10,0
16,306,306,zh_100307,"White: can maintain the temperature of the dog house, can be derived from the above experiment",10,0
17,52,52,zh_100053,White: because the average temperature of white makes the interior of the dog cage more warm and the difference in temperature with the initial temperature is not large.,10,0
18,140,140,zh_100141,White: The temperature inside the dog’s cage changes slowly and is small,10,0
