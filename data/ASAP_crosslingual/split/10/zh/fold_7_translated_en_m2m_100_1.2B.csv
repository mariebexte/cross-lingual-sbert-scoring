0,100,100,zh_100101,"White: White makes a brighter color, will make the dog cage look bright, the summer temperature is high, white is not easy to heat the dog cage is not too hot through the above experiment showed that the white temperature is the lowest in other colors compared.",10,2
1,308,308,zh_100309,"Black: After the end of the three experiments, the temperature of the air inside the glass bottle under the black cover is higher than the temperature of the air inside the glass bottle under the other colors, so that the black can better absorb energy, and it is easy to keep the dog's cage warm.",10,2
2,203,203,zh_100204,"Black: Black coatings can absorb light (energy) and increase the temperature of the gas, making the dog's cottage comfortable in the winter with the highest known black air average.",10,2
3,236,236,zh_100237,"Dark grey: absorbs part of the light heat and transmits the heat to the interior of the cage.Make it warm.The temperature rises from 24 ° C to 48 ° C, the temperature is stable.",10,1
4,107,107,zh_100108,"Black: The color of the black cover is deeper, the air temperature rises, the black absorbs more energy, and the air temperature in the black cover is highest.",10,1
5,117,117,zh_100118,"White: Because the dog's body temperature is generally higher, no higher temperature is required.",10,1
6,82,82,zh_100083,"Black: keep the temperature inside the dog cage warm, the heat absorption capacity is strongest Black, grey, light grey heat absorption capacity is strong.",10,1
7,268,268,zh_100269,"White: White does not cause excessive temperature, suitable for puppy life",10,1
8,204,204,zh_100205,"Black: It allows the dog to suck more heat in the light, making it warm.",10,1
9,105,105,zh_100106,Black: Gives enough heat inside the cage Black is more heat-absorbing than other colors,10,1
10,185,185,zh_100186,"White: The lighter the color of the cover, the smaller the temperature rise inside the dog cage.",10,1
11,238,238,zh_100239,"Black: Higher air temperature, highest average temperature",10,1
12,84,84,zh_100085,Black: The results showed that the temperature changes with the color.,10,0
13,172,172,zh_100173,White: Does not cause too much pollution,10,0
14,144,144,zh_100145,White: keeps the temperature inside the dog’s cage steady.,10,0
15,170,170,zh_100171,Dark grey: The dark grey reflects part of the light and absorbs most of the light to keep the temperature constant.,10,0
16,249,249,zh_100250,"Black: The deeper the color, the greater the heat absorption ability of the object.",10,0
17,90,90,zh_100091,"Dark grey: small temperature variation, small impact on dogs",10,0
18,234,234,zh_100235,"Light grey: First causes the temperature in the dog hut to remain constant, making it more suitable.Experiments have shown that light grey makes it more suitable for light to shine above and thus reach a constant temperature.",10,0
