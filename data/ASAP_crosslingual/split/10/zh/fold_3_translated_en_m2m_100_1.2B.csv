1,166,166,zh_100167,Black: Increased temperature Black has the highest average temperature,10,2
2,89,89,zh_100090,"Black: black can absorb all colors of light, the temperature inside the cage rises rapidly black color cover, the average temperature inside the cage_53°C, for the highest",10,2

4,87,87,zh_100088,"White: White affects the interior temperature of the dog cottage less widely and does not change suddenly.The experiment proved that through 3 experiments, the dog cage changed from 24 ° C to 10 minutes after the temperature changes were smaller and the color was lighter.",10,1
5,77,77,zh_100078,White: White makes the temperature of the dog cage much lower than other colors make the temperature of the dog cage lowest.White makes the average temperature of the dog cage lower than other colors makes the air temperature in the dog cage lower.,10,1

9,153,153,zh_100154,Black: Increased temperature Black is too high temperature,10,1
10,312,312,zh_100313,White: because white is light Heat absorption is less than other dark colors Other colors are too deep compared to white,10,1
11,18,18,zh_100019,"Light grey: The deeper the color, the greater the temperature rise, the highest the average temperature of black and the highest the temperature rise of black in each set of controlled experiments",10,1

13,135,135,zh_100136,Dark grey: Stabilizes air temperature and absorbs more energy.,10,0
14,113,113,zh_100114,Dark grey: The temperature inside the dog cage is kept constant The dark grey test difference is the smallest The temperature is constant for dogs to live.,10,0
