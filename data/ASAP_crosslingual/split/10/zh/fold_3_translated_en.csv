18,18,zh_100019,"Light gray:: the darker the color, the greater the temperature rise Black has the highest average temperature and the highest temperature rise in each control group",10,1
63,63,zh_100064,Light gray::: light color temperature rise slowly light gray temperature is not easy to rise sharply,10,0
65,65,zh_100066,Black:: Black absorbs heat and the temperature rises steadily at the same time. The comparison of charts and life examples show that black absorbs heat well.,10,1
77,77,zh_100078,White:: White makes the temperature of the kennel much less than other colors make the temperature of the kennel the lowest. White makes the average temperature of the kennel lower than other colors that make the air temperature in the kennel.,10,1
87,87,zh_100088,"White :: White has a smaller effect on the internal temperature of the kennel, and the change is not too abrupt. The experiment proved a total of _3 experiments, the kennel from 24 ℃ change to 10 minutes after the temperature change are less amplitude, lighter color",10,1
89,89,zh_100090,"Black::Black can absorb all colors of light, the temperature inside the kennel rises rapidly Black color lid, the average temperature inside the kennel _53 ℃, the highest",10,2
113,113,zh_100114,Dark gray:: Maintains a more constant temperature inside the kennel Dark gray has the least variance in experimental results Temperature is constant and suitable for dogs,10,0
119,119,zh_100120,White :: The temperature inside the kennel is not too high during the day. The average temperature inside the white bottle is the lowest.,10,2
124,124,zh_100125,Black:: The above data shows that the black temperature is the highest  ,10,1
135,135,zh_100136,Dark gray:: stabilizes the air temperature and absorbs more energy to make the kennel more comfortable,10,0
153,153,zh_100154,Black :: increase the temperature of the black are high,10,1
166,166,zh_100167,Black:: raises the temperature Black has the highest average temperature,10,2
179,179,zh_100180,"Dark gray:: The amount of heat absorbed will affect the internal temperature of the kennel, dark gray absorbs heat so that the internal temperature of the kennel is more even and does not fluctuate.",10,0
182,182,zh_100183,Dark gray:: the air temperature is stable,10,0
186,186,zh_100187,White:: Reflects all colors of light Temperature is _42°C on average,10,1
212,212,zh_100213,"White::: painted white The temperature inside the kennel is relatively stable and moderate Test results: the dog is comfortable, the owner is very relieved",10,0
227,227,zh_100228,"White::: so that the internal temperature of the kennel does not rise too high, both absorb light energy preservation and not too high, the temperature is too high dog will be very hot",10,1
229,229,zh_100230,"Dark gray:: dark gray in the three trials in the heat absorbed by the more constant, and thus will not be affected by the outside world more.",10,0
312,312,zh_100313,White::Because white is a light color heat absorption is less than other dark colors other colors are too dark compared to white,10,1
