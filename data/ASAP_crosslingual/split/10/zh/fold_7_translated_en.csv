82,82,zh_100083,Black:: keeps the temperature inside the kennel warm and has the strongest ability to absorb heat Black has a stronger ability to absorb heat than off-white and light gray,10,1
84,84,zh_100085,Black:: The experimental results all show that the temperature is changing with the color change.,10,0
90,90,zh_100091,"Dark gray:: the temperature change is small, the impact on the dog is small",10,0
100,100,zh_100101,"White:: white makes a brighter color, will make the kennel looks bright, high summer temperatures, white is not easy to absorb heat kennel is not too hot through the above experiment shows that the white temperature in other color comparison, the lowest temperature",10,2
105,105,zh_100106,Black:: gives enough heat inside the kennel Black has a higher heat absorption capacity than any other color,10,1
107,107,zh_100108,Black:: The color of the black lid is darker and the air temperature rises. Black absorbs more energy. The air temperature inside the black lid is the highest.,10,1
117,117,zh_100118,"White :: Because dogs generally have a high body temperature and do not need a higher temperature, a moderate temperature is sufficient",10,1
144,144,zh_100145,White:: The internal temperature of the kennel tends to stabilize,10,0
170,170,zh_100171,Dark gray:: dark gray can reflect part of the light to absorb most of the light to keep the temperature constant,10,0
172,172,zh_100173,White :: does not cause too much pollution and is suitable for living,10,0
185,185,zh_100186,"White:: The lighter the color of the lid, the less the temperature rise inside the kennel",10,1
203,203,zh_100204,"Black::Black paint can absorb light (energy), increase the gas temperature, so that the kennel in winter comfortable by the table can be known black air average maximum.",10,2
204,204,zh_100205,Black::It can make the kennel absorb more heat in the light and make it warm.,10,1
234,234,zh_100235,"Light gray::First of all, it causes the temperature in the kennel to remain constant, making it more suitable. Through experiments, we know that the light gray color makes the light on it and thus achieve a constant temperature more suitable",10,0
236,236,zh_100237,"Dark gray:: absorbs part of the heat of the light and transmits heat to the inside of the kennel. Make it warm. The temperature rises from _24℃ to 48℃, the temperature is stable.",10,1
238,238,zh_100239,"Black::High air temperature, black average temperature is the highest",10,1
249,249,zh_100250,"Black::The darker the color, the stronger the object's ability to absorb heat",10,0
268,268,zh_100269,White::White does not raise the temperature too much and is suitable for puppy life,10,1
308,308,zh_100309,"Black:: At the end of the three experiments, the air temperature in the glass bottle under the black lid was higher than the air temperature in the glass bottle under the lid of other colors, so black can better absorb energy and keep the kennel warm.",10,2
