0,85,85,zh_100086,"Black: compared to other colors over a certain period of time.The dog’s temperature rises rapidly.Through the same time of the above experiment, black absorbs more heat and heats up high.High average temperature.",10,2
1,274,274,zh_100275,"White: the heat absorption capacity of the paint is weak, it will not irritate the dog due to the high temperature, the white temperature change is the lowest in other colors, the change is slower, suitable for dogs to live.",10,2
2,224,224,zh_100225,"White: The temperature is wave-like, it is likely that the range will increase, but the average is almost unchanged, similar to the starting value, and the temperature is the lowest, and it is relatively suitable for the dog to rest, the result: experiment 1 is 42 ° C, experiment 2 is increased by 1 ° C.Three experiments were at 41 °C.",10,2
3,233,233,zh_100234,White: White does not affect the dog’s brain because the dog’s world is black and white and the temperature below white is the lowest.The lowest average temperature.,10,1
4,157,157,zh_100158,Light grey: control temperature will not be too high Light grey multiple experimental average is_45°C Reduced brightness in the eye damage is much less than black,10,1
