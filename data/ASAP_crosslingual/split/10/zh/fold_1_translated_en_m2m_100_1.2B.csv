0,237,237,zh_100238,"Choose black: Black can make the temperature of the cottage higher and warmer in the winter, and black has an average temperature of _53°C.",10,2
1,61,61,zh_100062,White: The temperature inside the cage is lower and the average temperature in white is_42°C,10,2
2,67,67,zh_100068,"Light grey: In the summer, the dog cage warms up but the temperature rise is not great In the dog cage is not hot In the winter, the dog cage warms up The temperature rise is not small In the summer, the dog cage is warmer _3 in the experiment, the light grey temperature is moderate",10,2
3,59,59,zh_100060,White: white colour light Absorption of light is poor This makes the temperature in the cage mild Not too hot to affect the sleep of the dog by the above data can be known white average temperature is the lowest most suitable for dog living,10,1
4,291,291,zh_100292,White: White can keep the temperature of the cottage approximately controlled at_42°C Dog is a constant temperature animal If the temperature is too high will make the dog uncomfortable So 42°C is the optimal temperature,10,1
5,86,86,zh_100087,"White: White_Three-time experimental temperature below 45 ° C is beneficial for dog survival White dog cage does not heat, the temperature inside the cage is not high Three-time temperature is 42 ° C, 43 ° C, 41 ° C average temperature is 42 ° C at 45 ° C below the best white",10,1
6,32,32,zh_100033,"White: White absorbs less heat does not cause the dog to feel uncomfortable in the high temperatures inside the cage, and white absorbs the least heat in the four colors.",10,1
7,286,286,zh_100287,White: The white colour is the lightest absorbs the least energy is the least energy is passed to the dog's cage also the least white makes the average interior of the dog's cage the least warm,10,1
8,74,74,zh_100075,"White: White absorbs less heat, reflects and is beautiful by the above experimental table can be observed that the low temperature of white is close to the human body temperature, will not cause too much discomfort to the dog.",10,1
9,24,24,zh_100025,White: White can reflect light so that the temperature in the bottle is not too hot The temperature in the white bottle is the lowest,10,1
10,178,178,zh_100179,White: White does not make the indoor temperature too high when the temperature is high Can make the dog less hot Paint the dog's cage in white and adjust the room temperature to_24 ° C In the indoor light after ten minutes measure the temperature and record Repeat the above experiment White is most suitable,10,1
11,93,93,zh_100094,"White: The light irradiates the white cover, it absorbs light to heat the interior and the reflective light to heat it down.  White has the lowest average temperature and low fluctuations, within the biologically tolerable range.",10,1
12,202,202,zh_100203,"White: The color is painted inside the dog cage, and the temperature tends to be flat.Keep the dog dry cool.",10,0
13,216,216,zh_100217,Dark grey: Change the temperature inside the cage and keep it at the same temperature.Dark grey increased the temperature by 24°C in trial 123 and kept it at 48°C.,10,0
14,254,254,zh_100255,Black: Place the black cover of the thermometer on the glass bottle to ensure that the actual temperature in the bottle is 24 ° C.,10,0
15,208,208,zh_100209,"Dark grey: The temperature of the air affected by the color reaches a certain temperature and remains unchanged, the higher the temperature the deeper the color is known by the table, the light grey temperature variation rate is the lowest.",10,0
16,155,155,zh_100156,White: makes the temperature change more smooth and low,10,0
17,275,275,zh_100276,Light grey: most suitable,10,0
18,133,133,zh_100134,Dark grey: Stabilizes air temperature and absorbs more energy.,10,0
