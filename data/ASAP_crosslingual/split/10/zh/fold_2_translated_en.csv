41,41,zh_100042,"Light gray:: The internal temperature of the kennel is higher during the day when it is exposed to sunlight compared to white pigment and lower compared to dark gray pigment, which is a more acceptable temperature for puppies. ",10,1
64,64,zh_100065,White:: as a kennel paint color makes the temperature inside the house less changeable,10,1
73,73,zh_100074,Dark gray:: the temperature is appropriate and the color is easy to sleep,10,0
79,79,zh_100080,"Light gray::While keeping the heat in, it will not affect the dog's view The temperature is _45℃ on average when the light is off, so it can keep the heat in",10,1
85,85,zh_100086,"Black::: Compared with other colors in a certain period of time. The temperature of the kennel increased faster than other colors. Warmth Through the above experiments in the same time, black absorbs more heat and warms up more. Average temperature is higher",10,2
97,97,zh_100098,"White:: The color affects the internal temperature of the kennel more moderate. Not too hot and not too cool White and black dark gray, light gray compared to absorb less heat.",10,0
127,127,zh_100128,White:: Cooler in summer to avoid heat,10,1
157,157,zh_100158,Light gray:: control the temperature will not be too high light gray repeated experiments average of _45 ° C when the light reduces the brightness of the eye damage is much less than black,10,1
159,159,zh_100160,Black:: Absorbs energy and then releases it into the kennel The temperature of black is the highest compared to the other three,10,1
163,163,zh_100164,White:: White color is clean and gives a delicate and comfortable feeling,10,0
200,200,zh_100201,Black:: absorbs heat to increase the internal temperature,10,0
209,209,zh_100210,"White::: is a fully permeable color does not absorb any material, the relative bit of the kennel interior preservation of good quality, the bottle is slower to rise with the external air temperature difference can be conducive to the survival of the puppy place.",10,0
213,213,zh_100214,"Dark gray:: the color makes the temperature of the kennel remains unchanged, can make the internal temperature of the kennel suitable for the dog's life living due to dark gray in the sunlight after _10 minutes to 48 ℃, and so it drops to room temperature 24 ℃ when the light again is still 48 ℃ thus it can be seen that the color can keep the internal temperature of the kennel constant",10,0
214,214,zh_100215,"Dark gray:: to ensure that the temperature inside the kennel must be fixed, the air temperature inside the dark gray lid remains unchanged",10,0
