0,78,78,zh_100079,"White: because white absorbs less heat, so the temperature inside the dog cage is lower confirmed: by contrast of four colors, white is found to absorb the lowest heat",10,2
1,45,45,zh_100046,White: When the sun irradiates to the white heat absorption of the roof of the cottage fully The temperature slowly rises When the sun goes down There is still heat in the cottage Because the white heat is slow The material in the experiment White and other _ three colours in ten minutes to absorb the least heat and absorb the same heat The white is the longest when the heat is used The longest when the heat is used,10,2
2,211,211,zh_100212,"White: so that the indoor temperature is not too high, the energy absorption rate of light is the lowest.",10,2
3,259,259,zh_100260,"Black: The highest number of tests, the highest temperature",10,1
4,193,193,zh_100194,"White: Under light irradiation, white absorbs less heat, most of the heat is dispersed, and the temperature of the glass bottle rises compared to other small ones.The lowest average after the white cover experiment.",10,1
5,21,21,zh_100022,"White: as the colour of the dog's colour, the light is less influenced by the white, the temperature is the most suitable for the dog's life.",10,1
6,62,62,zh_100063,Deep grey: will stabilize the temperature in the dog's cage comparatively harmonized confirmed: black light grey white and other absorption temperature is unstable so the researchers do not have a sufficient grasp it will be good for the dog's cage Deep grey is not necessarily the best but he can stay relatively stable more convincing,10,1
7,139,139,zh_100140,White: Lower increase in air temperature in the glass during the same time,10,1
8,256,256,zh_100257,"White: The internal temperature will not be too high and will not affect the normal activity of the dog.The above test corresponds to the white cover, and the temperature inside the bottle is stable at about -45 째 C.",10,1
9,248,248,zh_100249,"White: White has a smaller effect on its internal temperature, and the results in the above experiments are similar to those described.",10,1
10,293,293,zh_100294,Black: Black heat faster can keep warm when cold because black absorbs heat faster,10,1
11,104,104,zh_100105,Black: Black has the highest heat absorption capacity.,10,1
12,242,242,zh_100243,Light grey: stabilizing the temperature of the dog cottage_3 thermometer is measured to maintain a temperature of 45째C,10,0
13,272,272,zh_100273,White: White reflects the light.,10,0
14,108,108,zh_100109,Dark grey: the temperature square difference is smaller the colour is deeper the temperature is higher,10,0
15,71,71,zh_100072,White: because it is painted inside the dog cage so the dog cage heat dissipation is worse with white to absorb less heat and the dog itself also radiates heat so white is best,10,0
16,54,54,zh_100055,White: The temperature is milder,10,0
17,110,110,zh_100111,Deep grey: Keep the temperature inside the cage almost unchanged by the above_3 experiments Deep grey keeps the temperature inside the cage always at 48째 can be demonstrated,10,0
18,162,162,zh_100163,Dark grey: Keep the temperature inside the dog cage as set to ensure that the temperature is constant The temperature of the bottle in the dark grey cover is_48째C and remains unchanged,10,0
