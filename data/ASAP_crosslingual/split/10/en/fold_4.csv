255,255,en_cw_000937,"light_gray :: Light gray would be aesthetic and at the same time gives a very good temperature range compared to others. Although, the variance in temperature is inconsistent the rise in temperature is optimal. It indicates that light gray paint can help maintaining good temperatures in a doghouse in all seasons.",10,2
102,102,en_cw_000772,"white :: According to the results of the study, we can say that the white color absorbs less energy, so the white color would be ideal for the dog's house. That way he will not suffer from heat.",10,2
112,112,en_cw_000783,"white :: The average temperature of the white paint was the lowest, so painting it white would keep it cooler inside for the dog.",10,2
10,10,en_cw_000669,white :: As shown in experiment with white color temperature was low so this will be low and that will be good for dog.,10,1
60,60,en_cw_000729,white :: not to make it so hot inside the dog house,10,1
104,104,en_cw_000775,"white :: since the color white is a color that absorbs less energy is more favorable than the darker colors used in the experiment, the experiment showed that a house for white dogs would have a cooler interior to accumulate less energy to heat the air inside of the structure.",10,1
195,195,en_cw_000872,"white :: The inside of the doghouse could become more heated with darker colors. To keep an animal cooler a light color might work better, especially in warm climates.",10,1
19,19,en_cw_000678,"black :: the black color absorbs more energy, then the doghouse will be hotter.",10,1
134,134,en_cw_000809,white :: The white color makes the dog's doghouse cooler.,10,1
177,177,en_cw_000853,"light_gray :: the more dark is the color , the more increase in temerature",10,1
87,87,en_cw_000756,white :: The hypotesis was that dark colours absorbed more energy but the experiment showed that white colour keeps air fresher.,10,1
57,57,en_cw_000725,white :: Becsuse black causes temperature to rise more i would choose white if i lived in a warmer climate. If i lived in a colder temperature area i would choose black. To keep the animal comfortable,10,1
213,213,en_cw_000892,"white :: darker colors absorbs the most heat, because of can absorb all wavelengths of the light, reflecting none. Lighter objects reflects most wavelengths, absorbing less heat. That's why the temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was considerably lower than with the other darkest lids.",10,0

151,151,en_cw_000827,dark_gray :: dark gray gives more stable temp,10,0
223,223,en_cw_000903,light_gray :: Put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar.\n Make sure the starting temperature inside the jar is 24Â° C.\n Place lamp 5 centimeters away from the lid and turn on the lamp.\n After 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as Trial 1,10,0
