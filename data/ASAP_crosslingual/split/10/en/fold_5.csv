268,268,en_cw_000950,"white :: Considering a doghouse with direct sunlight, the best color to paint it with to keep a lower temperature inside would be color white. Looking at the results displayed in the experiment above, we can confirm that temperature inside a painted jar is lower the lighter the colour the jar is painted with, so that painting the doghouse white would allow our doghouse to maintain the lowest temperature when compared with the rest of the colors available.",10,2
260,260,en_cw_000942,"white :: If the colour are darker, the dog house temperature will be higher. It is because from the result, we can see that the increase in the temperature is the highest when the lid is in black colour. The amount of increase will then decrease with the darkness of the lid from 29 degree Celsius with black lid to 18 degree Celsius with white lid.",10,2
137,137,en_cw_000812,"white :: The white color of the doghouse will cause it to have an average temperature in the doghouse within 42 degrees C. It will be the lowest temperature of the subjects, but it is too high for the dog.",10,2
244,244,en_cw_000926,"white :: The results of the experiment suggest that using the color white as the paint color for the doghouse would decrease its inner temperature considerably in comparison with darker colors. This might be due to the properties of white paint, that causes a higher ammount of energy to be reflected and not absorbed.",10,1
21,21,en_cw_000680,white :: It's the only color that won't make the inside termperature of the dog house increase,10,1
114,114,en_cw_000785,"dark_gray :: The darker colours will result in a higher expected temperature inside the doghouse - as demonstrated in the results. As it is desirable to maintain a good temperature in warm and cooler conditions and that the front of the doghouse will be open, it would be best to choose a light or dark grey roof to achieve a balanced temperature inside the doghouse.",10,1
72,72,en_cw_000741,"white :: But we don't know if Brandi and Jerry are living in a cold place or warm place. Do they want the dog house to be warm for the dog, then they have to choose black. Otherwise, if they live in a hot place, they have to choose white.. you have to add some information there!",10,1
115,115,en_cw_000786,"white :: the color of an object is the color of the light it does not absorb, this means black absorbs the full spectrum of light, which means it absorbs the maximun amount of energy possible, which results in a higher temperature, this is why white paint will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler, cause white absorbs no light/energy (in teory)",10,1
36,36,en_cw_000699,"white :: as previously indicated in the hypothesis the darker colors tend to increase the temperature so the black color showed the greatest temperature increase followed by dark gray and light gray, while the white showed to be the color that lower temperature increases",10,1
15,15,en_cw_000674,white :: the lanco color is better so it does not absorb so much heat for a suitable temperature inside the house,10,1
285,285,en_cw_000968,white :: from the experiment it is clear that white colour absorbs less heat so that colour is the best for the work.,10,1
171,171,en_cw_000847,"white :: If the color used it's darker, the temperature raise more. When the color is more darker, it absorbes more light and, because of this reaction, it gets warmer.",10,1
288,288,en_cw_000971,"white :: It was shown that the color that absorbs less heat is the target, therefore, to maintain a temperature similar to the exterior of the house, this color would be selected.",10,0
252,252,en_cw_000934,dark_gray :: it may hp;d heat within,10,0
100,100,en_cw_000770,dark_gray :: I think dark grey would be best because it the color causes a consistent temperature throughout the experiment,10,0
62,62,en_cw_000731,"white :: Light colors, like white, do not absorb heat, they reflect it, that's why the temperature is lower.",10,0
70,70,en_cw_000739,"white :: The darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature inside the doghouse.",10,0
215,215,en_cw_000894,black :: Black color have a more temperature.,10,0
107,107,en_cw_000778,"dark_gray :: Dark gray can make feels the dog more confortable about the temperature, if is a sunny day It will feel like he can rest in a balance mode, if is a raining day the dark grey color will make it feel confortable",10,0
