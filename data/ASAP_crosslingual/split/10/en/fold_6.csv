25,25,en_cw_000686,white :: The darker the color the higher the temperature. The choice of color depends on whether you want to increase or decrease the temperature in the doghouse.,10,2
119,119,en_cw_000790,white :: as the data shows dark color absorbs more energy thus increasing the temperature of the substance so white is the color that can help to some extent in reducing the temperature of the house,10,2
139,139,en_cw_000814,"white :: The results of the experiment show that white gave the coolest internal termperature of the glass jars, thus I would select white, assuming that one would want to achieve the coolest temperature inside the doghouse of the four sample colours available.",10,2
167,167,en_cw_000843,"black :: I think the best color is black, because that color increase the temperature at most. That is important for dog expecially in winter months. Thank you",10,1
143,143,en_cw_000818,white :: in the summer the inside of the dog will not overheat,10,1
125,125,en_cw_000798,"black :: black, in a dog house will be warmer.",10,1
206,206,en_cw_000884,"white :: White color would prevent the inside of the doghouse from over heat, it aborbs lees energy.",10,1
76,76,en_cw_000745,"white :: the white color, not generating as much temperature as dark colors. It is perfect for the doghouse",10,1
16,16,en_cw_000675,white :: Using the data obtained by the experiment. The white color should be the best election for a hot climate. The fact of getting lower temperature results makes the dog house more comfortable for the animal avoiding hot situations and improving dog's quality life.,10,1
291,291,en_cw_000974,"white :: The darker colors provide too hot temperature in a doghouse on a sunny summer day. The white color ensures minimal changes in temperature, so it's the most convenient.",10,1
92,92,en_cw_000761,white :: Using darker colors can make the inside of the dog house to hot for the dog. Having the dog in such high heats could essentially kill the dog very quickly. You would want to use a lighter roof in order to ensure that the inside of the dog house remains cooler.,10,1
123,123,en_cw_000796,white :: White temperature is warm bot not hot; so the dog will not die for overheat,10,1
221,221,en_cw_000901,white :: affects so that it does not absorb energy\n and at less temperature in the air,10,0
120,120,en_cw_000791,white :: The color White is the most appropriate to paint the doghouse because it will keep it at a more pleasant indoor temperature.,10,0

249,249,en_cw_000931,"light_gray :: put the black lid with the thermometer attached to the glass bottle, ensuring the initial temperature of the bottle is 24 degrees Celsius, after 10 minutes measure the air temperature inside the container, repeat the steps with black light, dark gray, light gray and white",10,0
101,101,en_cw_000771,white :: Effect of paint color on temperature,10,0

203,203,en_cw_000881,"white :: The color of the inside of the doghouse would affect the heat absorption, white reflects more heat, black absorbs more heat",10,0
