90,90,en_cw_000759,"white :: IF the withe color keep the experiment cooler, then it shoul do the same for the dog house",10,2
261,261,en_cw_000943,"white :: The table shows that the white color is the least heated. For a comfortable existence of a dog, it is necessary that the temperature inside a doghouse rises as little as possible. Therefore, the best color is white",10,2
201,201,en_cw_000879,"white :: According to the results, white would be the coolest so perhaps the best color to paint a dog house. However, they just measured a small lamp area, and not a large doghouse sized area. I also think they should have tried more colors. And also, the climate where they are might help determine which choice would be the best for the safety of the dog.",10,2
41,41,en_cw_000705,white :: The doghouse will not contain so much heat because light colors are not good containers to contain the heat,10,1
295,295,en_cw_000978,"white :: The least heating showed white color, other colors led to more heating.",10,1
116,116,en_cw_000787,white :: The white color reflected most of the energy so the air temperature at doghouse will decrease,10,1
251,251,en_cw_000933,"black :: The darker the colour of the outer surface, the warmer the inside space will be. Black lids showed a higher temperature across all trials, while white was on the lower side of the spectrum.",10,1
208,208,en_cw_000886,white :: Considering that darker colors absorb more energy therefore absorbing more heat energy the best option would be to make a white dog house so that the dog stays at a low temperature,10,1
45,45,en_cw_000709,"white :: It depends on the type of climate if you want it not be so hot, the best option will be the white color, but if is in summer the best will be the black since it generates more heat.",10,1

187,187,en_cw_000863,black :: Black and other dark colors will attract and absorb heat from the sun and keep your dog warm.,10,1
50,50,en_cw_000718,black :: Black inside of the dogs house will make the house warmer because the dogs body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius and it will warm the house more then lighter color.,10,1
51,51,en_cw_000719,"black :: The black color significantly affected the temperature of the house because the darker colors determine it, reaching an average of 53 Â° C.",10,0
98,98,en_cw_000768,"white :: for white, the temperature changes slightly. therefore the best color for the dog house is white!",10,0
142,142,en_cw_000817,light_gray :: the color varies depending on the elements that are used in this case varies with white and light gray,10,0
180,180,en_cw_000856,white :: the white for being a light color would make the booth keep a more pleasant temperature for the dog.,10,0
