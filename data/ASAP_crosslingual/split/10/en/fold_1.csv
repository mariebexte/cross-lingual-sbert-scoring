132,132,en_cw_000807,"dark_gray :: The highest values are measured for black lid and the lowest for white lid.But since dogs have very good fur isolation, I would choose dark grey color for dogs house because that color shows constant value in the experiment, and it also ins't the highest or the lowest.",10,2
226,226,en_cw_000906,"white :: In my opinion I would be looking for a room where the temperature is not varied quickly by external elements, I mean to say a gentle change in temperature is comfortable for me, and likely true for a dog. From the experimental results, I can see the white color paint gave the least rise in temperature from the ambient starting temperature. Hence my choice, of white.",10,2

108,108,en_cw_000779,"white :: The lighter the color, the colder the temperature inside the doghouse. It would good for a dog to live in a white house if it lives in a hot place, but a black house would be better for one that lives in a cold place.",10,1

156,156,en_cw_000832,"white :: When exposed to a light source, the white color will still let the warmth of the light come through, but not as much as a darker color would. White has an average temperature of 42, compared to 53 from black, this is the best option for a dog house.",10,1
71,71,en_cw_000740,white :: White color affect less the temperature inside doghouse,10,1
37,37,en_cw_000700,white :: Painting the dog house white might result in a cooler temperature inside the dog house that is exposed to light/heat than if you were to use darker colors of paint. One thing to note is that the experiment tested results inside a sealed glass jar and a dog house is not typically made out of glass material therefore additional testing experiment with materials similar to the dog house materials would be needed to determine the validity of results.,10,1

141,141,en_cw_000816,"white :: Like explained on the steps above, darker colors tend to absorb a higher amount of sunlight, while light colors tend to reflect it, that is why a white doghouse would be the better choice if we want to reduce the temperature as much as we want.\n \n On cold enviroments, where some amount of heat would be needed for the dog's comfort, the other choices can be explored for extra warm.",10,1
