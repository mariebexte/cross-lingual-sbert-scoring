176,176,en_cw_000852,"white :: White reflects more color, and the frequency emitted is redirected to the space around, being the blackest color the one that absorb the radiation and turning into UV, heating the premise of the doghouse.\n I'm going to compare the average of the black color with the white, knowing that the color palette of the colors between them are in a linear level of results for absorption.\n Black (53ºC) and White (42ºC), making a difference in 11ºC in average between the colors after 10 minutes.\n I live in a warm climate so the perfect paint to use is the white, to disperse more energy and making the doghouse more chill.\n If I lived in Russia, I would paint the doghouse black on the winter, to absorb and heat more the doghouse.",10,2
281,281,en_cw_000963,"white :: The color of the doghouse would greatly affect the temperature inside the doghouse.\n I would definitely choose the color white because it has the less effect on the temperature inside. Base on the table, the color white shows lesser change in air temperature.",10,2
28,28,en_cw_000689,"white :: According to the results of the experiment, the white color of the lid of the bottle produced the lowest temperature inside the bottle, therefore if the dog's house is painted white, a lower ambient temperature will be obtained inside the dog's house",10,2
140,140,en_cw_000815,white :: The white color have less temperature.,10,1
17,17,en_cw_000676,white :: the darker the color the higher the temperature of the dog house so white is the best color for the dog house,10,1
172,172,en_cw_000848,"black :: The best color to use for a doghouse is black, to keep the dog warm and cozy. The black color will affect the temperature rising it, because darkest colors absob more energy.",10,1
234,234,en_cw_000916,"white :: The color of the outside affects the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. A dog could potentially get overheated if it has a darker color and it is built in a place that has the sun shining on it. For example, a black roof and outside of a doghouse could raise the average temperature by 11 degrees as compared to a white dog house.",10,1
150,150,en_cw_000826,"white :: The color will affect the temperature inside of the doghouse, the darker the color, the hotter the house. Should choose the white paint so that the temperature of doghouse would not rise too much when it's exposed to the sun for a long time, especially in summer.",10,1
33,33,en_cw_000696,white :: the white color is the best since it is the one that generates less heat,10,1
96,96,en_cw_000766,"white :: The darker the roof color, the higher the temperature in the dog’s booth",10,1
200,200,en_cw_000878,"white :: ACCORDING TO THE EXPERIMENT, THE WHITE COLOR IS ABSORBED TO MINIMUM HEAT SINCE IT KEPT A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE AND THEREFORE THE INTERIOR WAS MUCH MORE FRESH",10,1
80,80,en_cw_000749,dark_gray :: After the experiment the Dark Gray showed that it does not suffer any alteration of the temperature so it would be the ideal for the dog's house. Taking into account that you can maintain the right temperature without showing important variations.,10,1
148,148,en_cw_000824,dark_gray :: because this color is good for doghouse according to colors specialization.,10,0

216,216,en_cw_000895,"black :: As you probably already know, dark colors (black) will heat up more than light colors (white).White reflects more energy than black does. Given two identical glass containers - one being of one color A and another being of another color B and that they would be filled with, say, some identical heated liquid, and then allowed to cool .",10,0
214,214,en_cw_000893,black :: goo job,10,0
103,103,en_cw_000773,white :: Different colors have different refractive qualities. Some colors are able to absorb more light that others. The small differences in each trial could be because of errors in the instruments or variables that were not properly controlled.,10,0
265,265,en_cw_000947,dark_gray :: Dark Gray color will be the best choice for making a dog kennel. It maintains a constant temperature. The dog will create for itself a comfortable temperature that will depend on the temperature of the dog's body.,10,0
