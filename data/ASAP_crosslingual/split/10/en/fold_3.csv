64,64,en_cw_000733,white :: Using white will mean the temperature of the air inside the doghouse will be cooler as it's temperature increased the least during the experiment under the lamp.,10,2
186,186,en_cw_000862,"black :: The black color significantly affected the internal temperature in the experiment, having the highest increase of temperature among all the samples, because the black color is the darkest one, therefore, it absorbs more energy and, in this way, it generates a greater accumulation of heat.",10,2
78,78,en_cw_000747,"white :: A darker color house will be hotter in average than a light colored one, making it more uncomfortable for a dog in hot climates. This is drawn from the results, which show a decrease in temperature from darker to lighter colors. For colder climates, a dark color might be preferable.",10,2
31,31,en_cw_000693,"white :: Definitely the color that would be best for this product would be the white color, because it gives a lower temperature than the gray and black colors, keeping the body of the dog to a corded temperature with its body temperature",10,1
181,181,en_cw_000857,black :: It would increase temperature by a average of 11* C. This is useful for colder regions since even with limited sun light it will provide more warmth. Of course if the desired outcome is to cool then white should be used.,10,1
237,237,en_cw_000919,"white :: According to the study the white would keep the air inside the doghouse colder, because it would reflect more energy. If the desired effect was the contrary (make the doghouse warmer) then the best color would be the black",10,1
284,284,en_cw_000966,"white :: According to the results the most appropriate color would be the white, because it would keep the house less warm than with the rest of the colors, the heat that maintains the white color would be bearable by the dog, the other colors would not make it comfortable",10,1
175,175,en_cw_000851,"dark_gray :: Dogs have a higher body temperature than humans. In winter, they must be warm, but the black color is not for the summer because it will be very hot in the cottage.",10,1
48,48,en_cw_000713,white :: The white shows the lowest temperature in the doghouse which might be more appropriate for condition,10,1
130,130,en_cw_000805,white :: Dog house painted white in the summer will be as cool as possible.,10,1
18,18,en_cw_000677,black :: black absorbs all the light so it increases the temperature of the glass. the light works according to the VIBGYOR process.,10,1
52,52,en_cw_000720,"white :: Based on the results, the white color causes less temperature rise, that is, it is better for the dog's house",10,1
286,286,en_cw_000969,"white :: I would choose a white color, because according to the experiment is the color that absorb less energy. But keep in mind that a doghouse don't have a lamp and a white interior will get dirty quickly.",10,0
67,67,en_cw_000736,black :: black colour give the good way to provide them rest.,10,0
122,122,en_cw_000793,dark_gray :: Yes,10,0
197,197,en_cw_000875,black :: the reason is when the lamp overheats and this means that it turns black,10,0
290,290,en_cw_000973,light_gray :: A shelter for the dog should have adequate insulation to protect the animal from both soil moisture and extreme temperatures.,10,0
75,75,en_cw_000744,white :: white color will make doghouse more brightner and so it will be more spacious,10,0
56,56,en_cw_000724,white :: white seems to me the most appropriate color for its clarity,10,0
