1,136,136,es_3BQU611VFRXLP8DW78IDCMA806999Q,"White: When painted in white, the rays of the sun are reflected more, thus the amount of heat it absorbs is less, which is evidenced in the previously shown table. So it’s best to paint white to reduce the temperature inside the dog’s box.",10,2

3,323,323,es_3TOK3KHVJVVKICT9U03BVGERXTOO7D,"White: When the colour of the house is darker, it will attract and absorb the sunlight, making the house in the summer season to reach unhealthy temperatures for its pet. For that reason, painting it in white would be the most suitable because by being the house on the outside, the sun’s rays would not be absorbed by the house.",10,1

10,385,385,es_3Z7ISHFUH280HUCZ6E6YPEHQPAL8ZT,"The only effect of white is that in all tests itins a temperature below the other tests, since it is a clear color and the clarity makes it reflect the temperature and does not reach a high temperature.",10,1
11,384,384,es_3Z7EFSHGNBRDO22XM8YIUFXY74HCXL,"The best color to use is definitely white. In fact, this prevents excessive overheating to avoid burns. This happens because white diverts light particles and overheats less.",10,1
