In winter, any other colours used in the experiment would contribute to tempering more the temperature inside the house, but given the characteristics of dogs and their fur, it is more convenient to prioritize that in summer the temperature does not rise too much.",10,2

18,128,128,es_3AQF3RZ55AV78Z2BCNFT285HBTY6FK,"There is a classic house experiment that consists of putting a candle in a plate with a little water and tapping it with a glass. The candle consumes oxygen until it turns off, and the water enters the glass, since there the pressure has decreased a lot. It always goes out, it goes out very well and it’s very grateful... what’s not so clear is what’s really happening, and what’s the reason for that pressure variation. Javier Fernández Panadero, a few days ago, published about that here in Naukas (see), making it clear that the “classic” explanation is not the good one.",10,0
