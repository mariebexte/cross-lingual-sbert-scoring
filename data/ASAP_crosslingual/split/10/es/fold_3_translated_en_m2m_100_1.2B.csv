In the experiment, the glass bottle with white cap only reached 42 degrees, while the glass bottle with black cap reached 53, so it would be better for the dog if I used the white cap. It would be more fresh.",10,2

The dog can be comfortable during the summer living inside his cottage.",10,2

Air conditioners or heaters need a lot of electric current to keep a room at a stable temperature during the day and night. If all tests started with a temperature of 24C and consequently temperatures were recorded after different times, the gray color was not affected no matter how long the lid was exposed to light creating heat. This can be compared to the sunlight in a building and the hours the building is exposed to the sun.",10,0
