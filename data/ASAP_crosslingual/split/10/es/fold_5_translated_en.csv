75,75,es_35H6S234SCDF629M6B2KGWE4KN356T,"white :: the temperatures obtained by using the white color are the lowest, but they range from 41 to 43 degrees Celsius, which is a very high temperature for a dog to be in a kennel.",10,2
106,106,es_38YMOXR4MWC9JLO62CPT6WRH6AW6WI,"black :: In fact, the black color attracts more light particles (photons), which makes its thermal attraction increase faster and its thermal gradient will also be higher.",10,0

The temperatures for white were less than light gray, dark gray or black.  So it would probably be a good ceiling color.",10,2

This assumption does not take into account the effect of possible air flows in the hut as the hut is not totally closed like the boat in the experiment described.",10,2
