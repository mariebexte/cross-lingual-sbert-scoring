0,66,66,es_351SEKWQS2UCZI978XRK34ZILU7MDX,White: The white colour will keep the temperature of the box at a lower temperature than any of the other colours in the three tests; white colour was always the one that achieved a lower temperature.,10,2
1,204,204,es_3IGI0VL649X9LXLWA7K0RD0HUZ1NOA,"Light is nothing more than electromagnetic radiation and as such, it carries energy. Light colors, such as white, are the ones that most reflect radiation, and therefore absorb very little or radiate the energy they absorb very quickly. Dark colors, such as black or dark grey, are the ones that most absorb radiation. They are able to absorb a lot of this type of energy, and then they are radiating it slowly. In this way, if we use dark colors for our dog’s cottage, they will absorb sunlight during the day, and provide heat to our dog for longer throughout the night. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature inside the boat when the light is turned off, as seen in the results of the table, and the same will happen when the sun’s radiation ends at night. The temperature will be higher and the heat will be kept inside the case for longer.",10,2
