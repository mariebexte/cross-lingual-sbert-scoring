82,82,es_36H9ULYP647JWUHIW69IBCAMTDUJF3,"dark gray :: The best color would be dark gray because although the temperature rises more than with white, with gray it remains constant, which will also serve for the winter months by not cooling as quickly.",10,2
136,136,es_3BQU611VFRXLP8DW78IDCMA806999Q,"white :: When painted white, the sun's rays are reflected more strongly, so the amount of heat absorbed is less, as shown in the table above, so it is better to paint white to reduce the temperature inside the doghouse.",10,2

For this reason, painting the kennel white would be the most appropriate since the sun's rays would not be absorbed by the kennel since it is outside.",10,1

366,366,es_3X73LLYYQ3RZTGZ96UPA743GNXGHNI,"Depending on the size and breed of our dog we will differentiate 3 types of doghouses: doghouses for big dogs, doghouses for medium dogs or doghouses for small dogs. The perfect doghouse for your dog is the one that allows him to enter without any problem, to get up inside, to go for a walk when he is inside and to go to bed. If, on the other hand, we buy a doghouse that is too big, it will be more difficult to heat and our dog could become cold, especially in winter where temperatures are usually more extreme.",10,0
384,384,es_3Z7EFSHGNBRDO22XM8YIUFXY74HCXL,"white :: The best color to use is definitely white. In fact, this prevents excessive overheating to avoid burns. This happens because white deflects light particles and overheats less.",10,1
385,385,es_3Z7ISHFUH280HUCZ6E6YPEHQPAL8ZT,"white :: The only effect of white is that in all the tests it maintains a temperature below the other tests, since it is a light color and the clarity makes it reflect the temperature and does not reach a high temperature.",10,1
