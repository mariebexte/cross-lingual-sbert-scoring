19,19,es_31LVTDXBL9NMUAARQMLP8G1X2TCRLI,black :: THIS EXPERIMENT CAUSED TO CONCLUDE THE INSIDE WAS ALSO TOO MUCH BY THIS LAMP AND ITS HIGHER TEMPERATURE. THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE INTERIOR WAS AFFECTED.,10,0
105,105,es_38SKSKU7R3A91B780ZRGUO06FXVLIA,black :: You can make the environment darker at a certain point of view.,10,0

118,118,es_39U1BHVTDN4IULXUO5MKC98YOWU3TB,"white :: White does not absorb light as much as the other colors, but rather reflects it.  When light is not absorbed, then it does not heat up as much. That is why experiments with white paint have the lowest temperatures.",10,1
122,122,es_3A4NIXBJ78CVXUXZLEP8MH7NYWSLML,"white :: The experiment shows that the lighter the color, the less heat accumulates inside. Therefore, the best color for the roof of the doghouse is white. However, the minimum temperature reached in the experiment (41Â°C) is too high for a living being to withstand for a prolonged period of time.",10,2
126,126,es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV1YEO6J,black :: The black color maximizes the internal temperature and could be useful in the winter.,10,1

206,206,es_3II4UPYCOLK3KX7Z0QY1KDJNWT8QDP,light gray :: The difference in temperature between white and light gray is very little and the dog would enjoy the gray color more since they do not see in black and white.,10,0
210,210,es_3IRIK4HM3CX05NI1LLPSU2KEFFEC6M,white :: The white is the one with the lowest temperature in one of the studies compared to the others in the experiments.,10,1

268,268,es_3OXV7EAXLG3CSNMISSER1ZGK4IQ36V,"white :: When they paint the kennel for their dog, they care about the effects of the color on the temperature inside.  A dog will suffer a lot (and possibly die) in an environment that is too hot, and you need a kennel that does not absorb so much heat.  From the experiment, we can see that the darker lids retain more heat (from all the tests), and the white lid retains less heat.  Therefore, we can see that white is the best color if we are looking for a paint that will be cooler after a long time in the sun.  And a less hot temperature will be better for the dog.",10,2
270,270,es_3PDJHANYK7TRMVTH7D3T5THUNM96H4,"white :: The black color absorbs a lot of heat, not allowing light and heat to escape, that is why the temperature inside the house would increase in the case of black color. That is why I choose the white color to give more freshness to the house.",10,1
291,291,es_3R3YRB5GRHGXEJB4XPR44D86DF1UAN,"white :: The white color would be better for the kennel paint, because it absorbs less energy from the sun, and that is why the dog has a kennel that is not too hot. The experiment clearly shows that dark colors absorb more energy and more heat.",10,2

334,334,es_3U5JL4WY5MMATYPITTS0BHLAFMDX4W,"white :: I think that, if the doghouse is intended to protect the dog from heat and sun, the cover should be white because it would absorb less energy and therefore the inside would be cooler. If, on the contrary, the doghouse is to protect the dog from the cold, in that case the cover should be black, it would absorb more heat and light and the inside would be warmer.",10,1
345,345,es_3VBEN272MMCI9XW3UKOELY1LQB5SGP,dark gray :: it will give more xalor to the house because the solar energy will enter more to the interior because it is darker. It was also the color with the same score so the variety would be the same.,10,1
359,359,es_3WYGZ5XF3YSNBJSMKB9TJQTEXSNSKT,black :: for sure the black color will absorb more energy therefore heating the interior to a higher temperature.,10,1
