204,204,es_3IGI0VL649X9LXLWA7K0RD0HUZ1NOA,"black :: Light is nothing more than electromagnetic radiation and as such, it carries energy. Light colors, such as white, reflect radiation the most, and therefore absorb very little or radiate the energy they absorb very quickly. Dark colors, such as black or dark gray, absorb the most radiation. They are able to absorb a lot of energy of this type, and then slowly radiate it away. Thus, if we use dark colors for our dog's kennel, they will absorb solar radiation during the day, and provide our dog with warmth for a longer period of time during the night. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature inside the kennel will be when the light is turned off, as shown in the results of the table, and the same will happen when the solar radiation is gone at nightfall. The temperature will be higher and the heat will be maintained inside the house for a longer period of time.",10,2
