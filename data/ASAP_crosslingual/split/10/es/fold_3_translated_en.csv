23,23,es_326O153BMKBENUHURZ31QWU9F01ED4,"dark gray :: Dark gray can help use less energy no matter what time of day the building is exposed to the sun. Air conditioners or heaters need a lot of electrical current to keep a space at a stable temperature during the day and night. If all tests started with a temperature of 24C and consequently temperatures were recorded after different times, the gray color was not affected no matter how long the lid was exposed to light creating heat. This can be compared to the sunlight on a building and the hours the building is exposed to the sun.",10,0
80,80,es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAY8YHUW,"white :: Using a white lid will ensure that it is not so hot inside the kennel. In the experiment, the glass jar with white lid only reached 42 degrees, while the glass jar with black lid reached 53 degrees, so it would be better for the dog if I use the white lid. It would be cooler.",10,2
93,93,es_374TNBHA8D86I82QWMLFXYTOJW4QYM,"white :: It is not about increasing temperature, it is about light absorption and reflection. The color that has a high wavelength absorbs more light and is converted into heat, while low wavelength colors reflect the lights.",10,0
125,125,es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV072O6O,white :: During the hot and sunny seasons the optimal color to use would be white because after doing the experiment the results tell us that it is the color that absorbs the least energy from the lamp. The dog will be comfortable during the summer living inside his kennel.,10,2
129,129,es_3ATTHHXXWC1415OXEIU45IVTPQRXI1,"white :: The temperature changes depending on the color, if black makes the temperature go up then white makes it go down.",10,0
131,131,es_3B1NLC6UG19LW5GB23KKQTWA316GPP,black :: black because it will be warmer for the dog,10,1

221,221,es_3KJYX6QCMBO8SR38WLEMTYD8HF1VJ2,"white :: the white color, being a light color, does not absorb so much energy. According to the data table, the white color has the lowest temperatures being the most favorable.",10,1
227,227,es_3L2IS5HSFCV4Y25T6TW9QJS6DT8NUN,white :: Choosing the white color causes the temperature to be stable.,10,1
238,238,es_3M81GAB8A2WA509FMU7VPNVNUKCQBN,"white :: The white color would be more reflective and therefore block some of the sunlight during the day, which would allow the temperature to be lower inside the building.",10,1
293,293,es_3R6BYFZZP9PKREM7DAOJ2LI16Z8XFI,"white :: It all depends on the desired temperature, if you live in a warm place it is better to use white to keep the doghouse cooler. If you live in a cold place, black would be ideal to keep the kennel warmer.",10,1
300,300,es_3RSDURM96CZHL5CLNVQF3H4AVIPYE0,dark gray :: I think this color is perfect since black is very warm and white is not the right color for an animal since it will get dirty very quickly.,10,1

329,329,es_3TVSS0C0E3DFLJZIYPXMH6JVR5JWT6,white :: according to the results of the experiment the white color generated less heat inside the container based on the results the decision for the white color was made.,10,1
332,332,es_3U4J9857OGO0ZI40QVYPPWESQRY7BF,black :: The temperature of the house using the black color is going to be higher because after three tests this is the only color that has consistently disassembled from having a temperature of more than 50 degrees Celsius.,10,2
