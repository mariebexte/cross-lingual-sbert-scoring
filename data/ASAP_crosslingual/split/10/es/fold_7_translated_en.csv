51,51,es_34FNN24DCOMHPMJSCUXCZNYXHNO5YZ,"black :: According to the tests that were made, it is evident that the black color increased significantly more the temperature than the other colors. This is because the darker the color, the more energy absorption the object of that color has.",10,1

77,77,es_35K3O9HUADQBLEVQI5YREWXUP47FEM,white :: By using white color the temperature inside the house will be kept cooler than if dark colors are used.,10,1
78,78,es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAWKVHUF,"white :: Undoubtedly the best color is white because it will absorb less heat than darker colors. White could be a good color to use because in summer, when temperatures are usually high, the house will not increase its temperature excessively. This is because light hitting light surfaces is reflected, while light hitting dark colors is absorbed. This explains why in our experiment, the darker the color, the higher the temperature inside the container.",10,2
84,84,es_36NEMU28XHQB8O9YPSWAVSO3SL7MWM,white :: since dark colors absorb more energy by placing the white color we are allowing a lower temperature inside the house.,10,1

144,144,es_3CFVK00FWNYT8RC7YYIRXLA146UL68,"white :: White is the best color because it maintains the lowest temperature inside the doghouse.  If the kennel is temporarily outside in the sun, then the dog will be less likely to suffocate, as the average temperature with white inside the kennel is 42 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest of all the colors. However, if it is the autumn or winter season outside, then it will be better to choose black, as it will warm the doghouse better under the sun's rays outside.",10,2

Scientists test hypotheses by making predictions: if the hypothesis text YYY is correct, then text YYY should be true. They then perform experiments or observations to see if the predictions are correct. If they are, the hypothesis is supported. If not, it is time to make new hypotheses.",10,0
