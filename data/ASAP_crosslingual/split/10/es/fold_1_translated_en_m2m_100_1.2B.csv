0,291,291,es_3R3YRB5GRHGXEJB4XPR44D86DF1UAN,"The white colour would be better for painting the case, because it absorbs the least energy from the sun, and that is why the dog has a case that does not have too much heat. The experiment clearly shows that dark colors absorb more energy and more heat.",10,2
1,122,122,es_3A4NIXBJ78CVXUXZLEP8MH7NYWSLML,"White: The experiment demonstrates that the clearer the color the less heat accumulates inside. Therefore, the best color for the roof of the dog case is white. However, the minimum temperature reached in the experiment (41Â°C) is excessively high to support a living being for an extended period of time.",10,2
2,268,268,es_3OXV7EAXLG3CSNMISSER1ZGK4IQ36V,"White: When they paint the box for their dog, they care about the effects of color on the temperature inside.  A dog will suffer a lot (and possibly die) in an environment that has too much heat, and a case that does not absorb so much heat is needed.  By the experiment, we can see that the darker tapes retain more heat (for all tests), and the white tap retains the least heat.  Therefore, we see that white is the best color if we look for a paint that will have the coldest after a long time in the sun.  And a less hot temperature will be better for the dog.",10,2
3,126,126,es_3AMYWKA6YDZ1ECF4BQYJP2EV1YEO6J,Black: The black color maximizes the internal temperature and could be useful in winter.,10,1
4,210,210,es_3IRIK4HM3CX05NI1LLPSU2KEFFEC6M,White: White is the one with the lowest temperature in one of the studies compared to the demnas of the experiments.,10,1
5,334,334,es_3U5JL4WY5MMATYPITTS0BHLAFMDX4W,"white :: I think if the dog case is meant to protect the dog from heat and sun, the lid should be white because it would absorb less energy and therefore its interior would be cooler. If, on the contrary, the case is to protect the dog from the cold, in that case the lid should be black, absorb more heat and light and the interior would be warmer.",10,1
6,118,118,es_39U1BHVTDN4IULXUO5MKC98YOWU3TB,"White: White does not absorb light as much as other colors, but it reflects it.  When the light is not absorbed, then it is not so hot. This is why experiments with white paint have the lowest temperatures.",10,1
7,243,243,es_3MTMREQS4XVA6N09SP65M1T3Z4CWA7,Black: The black is warmer according to the results.,10,1
8,359,359,es_3WYGZ5XF3YSNBJSMKB9TJQTEXSNSKT,Black: Certainly the black colour absorbs more energy thus heating the interior to more temperature,10,1
9,270,270,es_3PDJHANYK7TRMVTH7D3T5THUNM96H4,"White: Black absorbs a lot of heat, not allowing light and heat to escape, which is why the temperature inside the box would increase in the case of black. This is why I choose the white color to give more freshness to the house.",10,1
10,345,345,es_3VBEN272MMCI9XW3UKOELY1LQB5SGP,Dark grey: It will give more space to the caset so that the solar energy enters more inside because it is darker. It was also the color that remained of the same score as the variety would be the same.,10,1
11,16,16,es_31JLPPHS2W72HTSMSO0LIZ2BURA3OX,"White: The white color does not absorb as much heat as the other colors, and it would be better that the case does not heat so that the dog does not suffer the heat of summer.",10,1
12,115,115,es_39LOEL67OUIZW156L7BPLDCBEE583H,"White :: THE BALCON COLOR IS VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE it's MIGHT IN TEST 42,43 It's A VERY ATTRACTIVE COMBINATION AND TEST 3 OF 41 IS ALSO BRILLING OF THE RESULTS, AND YOUR PERFECT DOG COLOR AND DOG COLOR 42 IS VERY DOG COLOR",10,0

15,206,206,es_3II4UPYCOLK3KX7Z0QY1KDJNWT8QDP,The temperature difference between white and clear gray is very small and the dog would enjoy the grey color as they do not see in white and black.,10,0
