1,78,78,es_35L9RVQFCQVCO6JI3V1WLZVAWKVHUF,"Definitely the best color is white because it will absorb less heat than the darker colors. The white could be positive to use it because in summer, when there are usually high temperatures, the case will not increase its temperature excessively. This is because the light that impacts on clear surfaces is reflected, while the light that impacts on dark colors is absorbed. This explains why in our experiment, the darker the color, the higher the temperature inside the container.",10,2
2,144,144,es_3CFVK00FWNYT8RC7YYIRXLA146UL68,"White is the best color because itins the lowest temperature inside the dog’s box.  If the box is temporarily out in the sun, then the dog will have less chances of suffocating, since the average temperature with the white color inside the box is 42 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest of all colors. However, if it is out of the fall or winter season, then it will be better to choose the black color, because outside this color would heat the dog's house better under the sunlight.",10,2

6,51,51,es_34FNN24DCOMHPMJSCUXCZNYXHNO5YZ,"Black: According to the tests that were made, it is evident that black increased the temperature significantly more than the other colors. This is because the darker the color, the greater energy absorption has the object of said color.",10,1
7,35,35,es_336YQZE83XRHV5UETR915SBQC7QM5Y,"White: Based on the results between the more clear less energy absorbs. The color is white, the temperature is lower than the color is black.",10,1

11,237,237,es_3M68NM076JK4BP7K3IFNJXJ0AVM6RG,"White: The white color reflects the light so it warms less. The darker the color, the more light it attracts and the more heat it concentrates.",10,1
12,171,171,es_3EG49X351WPO8LTWCHLF8F5ODRWX6O,"One hypothesis is not necessarily correct. Rather, it’s the “best assumption” and scientists need to test it to see if it’s really right. Scientists test hypotheses by making predictions: if the text \n hypothesis is correct, then text YYY should be true. They then perform experiments or observations to see if the predictions are correct. If so, the hypothesis is sustainable. If not, it is time to make new suggestions.",10,0
