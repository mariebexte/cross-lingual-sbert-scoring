50,50,es_34BBWHLWHCOPC5J74DYI3ZHMF5OWI7,"white :: In a warm place, with a lot of sun, a light or white color would make the temperature inside the house as low as possible, with a difference of up to 12º with respect to a black color.  Depending on the location of the house, it could also be interesting to paint it in a dark color, to increase this temperature.",10,1

128,128,es_3AQF3RZ55AV78Z2BCNFT285HBTY6FK,"light gray :: There is a classic home experiment that consists of putting a candle in a dish with a little water and covering it with a glass. The candle consumes oxygen until it goes out, and the water goes into the glass, since the pressure there has decreased a lot. It always comes out, it comes out very well and it is very grateful... what is not so clear is what really happens, and what is the reason for this pressure variation. Javier Fernández Panadero, a few days ago published about it here in Naukas (see) making it clear that the ""classical"" explanation is not the good one.",10,0
145,145,es_3CN4LGXD5Z1ZT3FSYPE2UVSJKLX4YO,white :: The white color does not absorb heat and will not raise the temperature of the kennel. In summer the dog will be able to stay inside the kennel without being hot.,10,1

189,189,es_3H7Z272LX9K1IXUCDUH03L1IZ8IPLA,"white :: White is the color that would raise the temperature inside the kennel the least on hot days (18 °C above the initial temperature, compared to almost 30 °C when black is used). In winter any other of the colors used in the experiment would contribute to temper the temperature inside the kennel, but given the characteristics of the dogs and their coat, it is more convenient to prioritize that in summer the temperature does not rise too much.",10,2
191,191,es_3HHRAGRYXAIOWVH29X1V9C5XSIG9OC,"white :: According to the results, white is the color that absorbs the least heat from the sun's rays, so the temperature inside the doghouse will not be as high as if it were painted with other colors.",10,2

226,226,es_3L0KT67Y8GTIVOH3OQAKSY8PZV2YSG,white :: Because the white color provides energy and also gives an aesthetic form of the house.,10,0

260,260,es_3OHYZ19UGEI21ER713FV57GHWVJOAF,white :: Painting the house white will keep it cooler as light colors retain less heat.,10,1

303,303,es_3RU7GD8VPQ6OMAP2X3E1F7FDSP4SPG,white :: We will choose white for the doghouse to keep it cooler in the sunlight. After testing it is observed that the white cover absorbs less heat than any other color.,10,2

374,374,es_3YDGXNSEO17KEXOALLG8VI4HOCP84I,"white :: Color has a great effect on the house. The darker the color, the warmer the house will be. So white is the best color for the dog house.",10,1

If it is a hot climate then white paint is the best option but if it is a cold environment then black or dark gray are the best options.",10,1
