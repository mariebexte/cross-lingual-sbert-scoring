24,24,de_000627,"black :: The cottage would be warm in summer and probably cold in winter, poor insulation.",10,1
29,29,de_000632,black :: Black makes the doghouse warm even in winter.,10,1
32,32,de_000635,black :: there must be enough air in the dog house 2 air speed must be adjusted 3. it must uahc not so cold and not so warm in the dog house,10,0
51,51,de_000654,"white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy",10,1
54,54,de_000657,white :: the darker the color the hotter it gets inside the doghouse,10,0
79,79,de_000682,"white :: the darker the color, the higher the temperature",10,0
88,88,de_000691,"dark gray :: Dark gray 48, 48, 48 It allows us to be in a not so dark tone.",10,0
97,97,de_000700,white :: A white roof of the doghouse prevents the interior from overheating in the summer.,10,1
99,99,de_000702,white :: The temperature inside the doghouse will be the lowest.,10,1
105,105,de_000708,black :: The interior of the hut is heated differently depending on the color.,10,0
106,106,de_000709,"white :: The darker the color, the more is absorbed and the higher the internal temperature rises accordingly. White color is characterized by the lowest absorption capacity, black color by the highest absorption capacity. Especially in summer, black color could be disadvantageous.",10,1
129,129,de_000732,"light gray :: the light gray will make the kennel only warm but not too hot, average 45 C, so it is suitable for live animals.",10,1
132,132,de_000735,"light gray :: light gray is warm, not very hot, so it is most suitable because 45 degrees is not so hot",10,1
191,191,de_000794,"white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.   So the recommended kennel is the white",10,2
210,210,de_000813,"white :: Analogous to the experiment, it is likely that a white paint color absorbs less energy than the other colors available for selection, and thus the air temperature increase due to irradiation is lower. Instead of artificial lighting by a lamp in the experiment, the doghouse is exposed to the sun in reality, which, however, is expected to produce similar results. In the experiment, it can be seen that the air temperature rise is lowest for white lid color compared to the other colors tested (about 12Â°C lower than black lid color after 10min).",10,2
227,227,de_000830,"white :: If the doghouse is painted white, it will not heat up as much under sunlight as if it were painted darker. However, the temperature rise in the doghouse will not be as extreme as in the jam jar, because the doghouse is open in the front and so air can circulate.",10,1
265,265,de_000868,"hellgrau :: Hello, unfortunately this task is not feasible for me,I have always been a niete in chemistry.",10,0
279,279,de_000882,black :: The black painted roof absorbs solar energy and transfers it as heat to the interior.,10,0
285,285,de_000888,"White :: The experiment has confirmed the hypothesis of the boys. The lighter the color of the lid, the lower the temperature in the jar. Accordingly, the also white color of the doghouse will help it not to heat up so much.",10,2
