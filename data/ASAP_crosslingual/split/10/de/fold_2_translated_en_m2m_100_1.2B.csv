0,217,217,de_000820,"In the experiment of Tim and Jan, it is observed that the darker the surface, the higher the temperature inside the container. This is because the dark colors are absorbed by the surface and the heat is transmitted to the air in the dog hut by convection and heated. Brighter colors, such as white, reflect light and heat, the surface remains cooler, as does the interior of the swinger.",10,2
1,273,273,de_000876,"Tim and Jan’s experiment has shown that the color of the paint has a great influence on the interior temperature. The slightest warming occurred with the colour white and should therefore be applied to the dog hut.  This will keep it warm inside, but not as strong as other colors.",10,2
2,20,20,de_000623,"White: The white paint color would reflect the maximum amount of light, thereby warming the cabin the least. In the experiment, white has a threshold. 11 degrees lower temperature shown than black, and approx. 3 degrees lower than light grey.",10,2

9,198,198,de_000801,I would choose the lighter color so it doesn’t get so hot as the experiment says that the dark colors absorb more energy,10,1
10,243,243,de_000846,"The perception of colors arises from the reflection/absorption of certain proportions of visible light, where black means relatively low reflection and white means relatively high reflection. The absorption of light also affects the temperature, so black objects in the sun would have to heat up faster than white ones. Tim and Jan’s experiment supports this thesis.",10,1
11,203,203,de_000806,"White: Darker colour stores more heat, absorbs, and continues to heat up.  The brightest color (white) makes the most sense since the temperature is the lowest/nearest to the original temperature.",10,1
12,122,122,de_000725,"dark grey :: As for the different colors that have absorbed the most heat, I think the main consideration might be how dark those colors were. I would think blue and purple’t take up so much; unless they were very dark blue and purple. Here is a spectral analysis of heat bulbs: http://heelspurs.com/a/led/black3.gif which shows how you can expect heat bulbs to emit the most energy in colors to the red end of the spectrum than expected. That would explain orange – did you try red too? Why did the coloured liquids absorb more heat than the paper-coated ones? I hope other experts can help, but consider how heat absorption works. With the paper, part of the heat is exposed, and the paper absorbs the energy, transfers it to the glass (and may also have some air between the two), which then transfers it to the water. In the colored waterfall, heat absorption occurs directly in the water, which should be more efficient. Did you have a control without coloring? How much has it warmed?",10,0
