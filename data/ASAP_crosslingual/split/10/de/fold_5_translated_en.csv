25,25,de_000628,"black :: Because I have chosen """"Black"""" the doghouse will heat up a little more in the summer. But this is not a problem, because this generally has an entrance that is always open. Here is air circulation and lowers the temperature. In winter, however, a dark color is advantageous because the doghouse does not cool down so quickly.",10,1
31,31,de_000634,"white :: the darker the color, the warmer it gets",10,1
34,34,de_000637,white :: The darker the color the more temperature rise.,10,0
40,40,de_000643,"white :: You can clearly see that black leads to a much stronger warming (you know it yourself, if you wear something black in the summer - you sweat there much faster, because, as already found out, black absorbs more and accordingly it """"underneath"""" becomes warmer. However, it is questionable whether just a roof color for big differences (smaller ones do, but not like in the experiment. It probably depends on the material from which the hut is built.",10,1
58,58,de_000661,"white :: white, so that it is not too hot in the doghouse",10,1
85,85,de_000688,"white :: The paint color has an influence on the air temperature in the hut. In relation to the experiment, white is best suited, since darker colors would reach too high a temperature.",10,0
109,109,de_000712,"black :: apparently the temperature in the doghouse will be 30°C higher, because the color is dark. according to the results of the experiment, the temperature would only increase by about 18°C with white.",10,1
111,111,de_000714,black :: black is the hottest color because it absorbs the highest light and therefore the energy and is therefore the most comfortable for cultivation,10,1
123,123,de_000726,light gray :: the choice of color could also adjust the air temperature inside the cabin,10,0
140,140,de_000743,"dark gray :: The only stable color is dark gray, it seems to me the best choice for the interior of the doghouse.",10,0
166,166,de_000769,"white :: When the color is dark, the interior warms up. The dog hat, which is in the sun, does not have to be dark. It is necessary to use light colors because dogs are hotter because of the hair",10,0
196,196,de_000799,"dark gray :: since the doghouse is open, the color is not critical for the temperature. The dog should be warm. A dark roof is easier to maintain.",10,0
213,213,de_000816,"white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy",10,2
244,244,de_000847,"white :: It can be seen that darker colors lead to heating much faster (as evident in the experiment above). Especially in direct sunlight, colors like black would have to heat up very quickly. Accordingly, in summer, a hut of white is highly recommended. In winter, however, the color black can probably store heat longer, which is why a darker hut might be more advisable in winter.",10,1
245,245,de_000848,"light gray :: The darker the color of the paint, the more the temperature in the hut will rise. Therefore, not black and not dark gray, because in the summer the temperatures in the hut would reach dangerous,unhealthy heights for the dog. White will not warm up the inside of the kennel at low temperatures, especially in winter. Thus, light gray is the best choice, the slight measurement deviations D1, D2, D3 are not significant. Although dark gray is the color that is the only one that provides stable readings, reliably aborbs, I consider this color to be risky to the dog's health because of the rather strong absorption of solar heat and its release into the hut interior, like black, when outside temperatures are high.",10,2
248,248,de_000851,white :: It becomes warmer the darker the color is. White is the coldest.,10,1
274,274,de_000877,"dark gray :: the darker the color, the warmer the interior becomes when exposed to light. i would use a dark color for the dog so that it does not freeze, but not black so that it does not get too hot",10,1
281,281,de_000884,White :: The darker the paint color the warmer it is in the doghouse.,10,0
283,283,de_000886,"White :: The experiment has shown that a vessel with a white surface is heated less by irradiation than one with a different color surface. Therefore, the hut with white paint will probably heat up less by solar radiation.",10,2
