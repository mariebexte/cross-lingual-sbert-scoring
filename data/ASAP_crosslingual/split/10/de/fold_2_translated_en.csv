20,20,de_000623,"white :: The white paint color would reflect a maximum amount of light and thus heat up the hut the least. In the experiment, white showed an average temperature about 11 degrees lower than black, and about 3 degrees lower than light gray.",10,2
22,22,de_000625,"light gray :: - the temperature remains the same, is more comfortable for the dog",10,0
37,37,de_000640,"white :: The dog house could heat up so much in summer that it is dangerous for the dog. Therefore, you should take a light color to allow the dog a comfortable temperature.",10,1
44,44,de_000647,"black :: The darker the paint color, the higher the temperatures inside the painted object. Whereby the specific arrangement of the passage has only a small effect on the temperature.",10,1
46,46,de_000649,"White :: The paint color affects the inside temperature. Black paint is suitable for winter, white for summer",10,0
68,68,de_000671,"white :: white is best,so that the dog house does not heat up too much.",10,1
72,72,de_000675,"white :: The greater the darkness of the color, the greater the degree of heat absorption as a basis for the results for black color 54 52 54 53",10,0
73,73,de_000676,"white :: With black varnish, the hut is heated the most by solar radiation, which could be uncomfortable for the dog, possibly even dangerous. With white lacquer the temperature in the hut increases the least.",10,1
90,90,de_000693,"white :: For the house of dogs lamp is not necessary, because of this the temperature is very high",10,0
122,122,de_000725,"dark gray :: As for the various colors that absorbed the most heat, I think the main consideration might be how dark those colors were. I would think that blue and purple would not absorb as much; unless they were very dark blue and purple. Here's a spectral analysis of heat lamps: http://heelspurs.com/a/led/black3.gif that shows how you might expect heat lamps to emit the most energy in colors toward the red end of the spectrum than expected. That would explain orange - did you try red as well? Why did the colored liquids absorb more heat than the paper covered ones? I hope other experts can contribute, but consider how heat absorption works. With the paper, some of it is exposed to heat, and the paper absorbs the energy, transfers it to the glass (and may also have some air between the two), which it then transfers to the water. In the colored waterfall, the heat absorption is directly in the water, which should be more efficient. Did you have a control without coloring? How much did it heat up?",10,0
124,124,de_000727,"white :: Meanwhile in the experiment of Tim and Jan it is demonstrated that to more clarity smaller temperature, if the doghouse is for a warm place, he/she would paint it of white, and if it is for a cold place, he/she would paint it of black.",10,0
198,198,de_000801,"white :: I would choose the lighter color so that it does not get so hot, because in the experiment it is said that the dark colors absorb more energy",10,1
201,201,de_000804,"white :: In case of strong sunlight, the doghouse with a white roof would heat up less than with a black, dark gray, light gray roof.",10,1
203,203,de_000806,"white :: Darker color retains more heat, absorbs, heats up further.  The lightest color (white) makes the most sense, because the temperature is the lowest / closest to the original temperature.",10,1
206,206,de_000809,"white :: The darker the color, the warmer it will be inside. White color would be recommended, so that the dog is not too warm.",10,1
212,212,de_000815,"white :: the darker the color, the higher the temperature in the cabin, the worse for the dog (at least in summer).",10,0
217,217,de_000820,"white :: In the experiment of Tim and Jan it is observed that the darker the surface, the higher the temperature inside the container. This is because the dark colors are absorbed by the surface and the heat is transferred to the air in the doghouse by convection and warmed. Lighter colors, like white, reflect light and heat, and the surface stays cooler, as does the inside of the kennel.",10,2
243,243,de_000846,"white :: The perception of colors results from the reflection/absorption of certain portions of the visible light, where black means relatively low reflection and white means relatively high reflection. The absorption of light also affects temperature and so black objects should heat up faster in the sun than white ones. The experiment of Tim and Jan supports this thesis.",10,1
273,273,de_000876,"white :: Through Tim and Jan's experiment, it has been found that the color of the paint has a great influence on the internal temperature. The least heating took place with the color white and this should therefore be applied to the doghouse.  This will still cause it to heat up inside, but not as much as other colors.",10,2
