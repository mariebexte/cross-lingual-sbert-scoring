This is clearly seen in the measurements of Tim and Jan's experiment, where the inner temperature of the glass at the black cover is approx. 53 °C, while the interior temperature with the white cover is only approx. It is 42°C.",10,2

2,202,202,de_000805,"light grey: The paint color may affect the interior temperature of the dog hut, because the experiment has shown: the darker the color, the warmer it is in the dog hut.  In summer, therefore, white appears to be better, as it is warm anyway and a dark paint color creates unbearable temperatures, while in winter, where it is cold, a darker paint color contributes to a pleasantly warm temperature. Therefore, light grey or dark grey seems to me to be a good compromise.",10,2

Place the lamp 5 cm away from the lock and turn on the lamp. Miss the temperature inside the glass after ten minutes and record the temperature as a passage 1. Turn off the lamp and wait until the temperature in the glass has fallen back to the initial temperature. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for passages 2 and 3.
