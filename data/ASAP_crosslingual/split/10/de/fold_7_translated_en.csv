1,1,de_000604,"white :: The white paint reflects the light instead of absorbing it, thus the temperature does not rise as fast and does not get as hot as the black paint. In the experiment, white was presented with the best results. The white paint is cooler under illumination up to 13Â°C.",10,2
28,28,de_000631,"white :: The darker the color, the warmer the hut, so use the lightest possible color (white).",10,1
39,39,de_000642,"light gray :: I choose light gray so that the temperature is constant in winter as well as in summer. Black would mean that it gets hot, especially in summer, white would be ideal in summer, black actually never, but since white does not give off much energy even in winter, so I took light gray for a constant temperature",10,1
74,74,de_000677,white :: The temperature in the canning jar is higher the darker the color of the lid. This process will be repeated similarly in the doghouse. To build the dog as cool as possible hut would be preferable white color.,10,1
86,86,de_000689,"white :: White 42, 43, 41, 42 It is clearer and reflects more light.",10,0
91,91,de_000694,white :: The dark paint warms up more and easier. That is why the temperature in the doghouse is higher.,10,0
101,101,de_000704,white :: due to the outer color it could be very warm inside the hut so bad for the dog white has the lowest temperature,10,1
110,110,de_000713,white :: the darker the color the higher the temperature inside -> see albedo,10,0
141,141,de_000744,white :: The results show that colors have an influence on the temperature inside a dog house. The results from the experiment suggest that white is appropriate in summer and black in winter.,10,0
153,153,de_000756,"white :: To make the kennel as comfortable and as cold as possible, the lighter color should be used, because it does not make the room hotter and cooler. This color allows dogs to feel very well",10,1
164,164,de_000767,dark gray :: a constant temperature can be obtained,10,0
177,177,de_000780,"white :: As in the glass, the doghouse could have an increased temperature with darker colors. Due to the sunlight, the heat is stored and transferred to the interior. A lighter color reflects the color and the kennel is much cooler.",10,1
192,192,de_000795,"white :: As in the experiment, the paint color could harden too much under the influence of the sun's heat in certain colors.",10,0
197,197,de_000800,"white :: Depending on which one you choose sometimes warmer sometimes colder (theoretically) According to the results black has an extremely warm effect and the lighter the color becomes the """"cooler"""".",10,2
234,234,de_000837,"white :: As it is said and shown that dark colors absorb more energy, which translates into an increase in temperature, it would be ideal to place colors as bright as white, for example.",10,1
235,235,de_000838,"white :: Depending on the outer color of the doghouse, higher or lower temperatures may occur inside when exposed to strong sunlight.",10,0
246,246,de_000849,"white :: The darker the color, the warmer the inside of the doghouse (see experiment). Therefore, white, so that the dog is not too warm and suffer.",10,2
254,254,de_000857,white :: The temperature in the doghouse should rise slightly - but less in a white doghouse than in a grey or even black doghouse,10,1
295,295,de_000898,"White :: As the experiment shows, the color of a canning jar lid has an influence on the heating of the air inside the jar when irradiated directly with a lamp: the darker the lid, the more the air inside heats up. The tendency of this observation can probably be transferred to a doghouse, the roof of the doghouse and direct sunlight. Accordingly, the interior of a doghouse with a black roof would heat up significantly more than that of a doghouse with a white roof when the sun shines on it.",10,1
