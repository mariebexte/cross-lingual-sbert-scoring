0,21,21,de_000624,"White: the black and dark grey paint colours are likely to heat the interior of the cabin more under sunlight than light grey and white, because in the glass experiment under these covers the highest temperature in the glass was measured. Therefore, white would be best suited so that the cottage does not heat up too much.",10,2
