21,21,de_000624,"white :: the black and dark gray paint colors are likely to heat up the interior of the hut more than light gray and white when exposed to sunlight, because the highest temperature in the glass was measured under these lids in the glass experiment. Therefore, white would be most suitable so that the hut does not heat up too much.",10,2
27,27,de_000630,"light gray :: The paint color will affect the air temperature, the darker the paint the warmer the air temperature inside.",10,1
35,35,de_000638,"white :: in summer it is not so hot in the hut, because little energy is absorbed",10,1
48,48,de_000651,"white :: The darker the color, the higher the air inside heats up.",10,0
60,60,de_000663,"light gray :: The paint color will also affect the temperature inside, but much less, because it is not enclosed in glass. So that it is not too hot in the summer -> light gray?",10,1
94,94,de_000697,white :: It is necessary that this color becomes clearer,10,0
95,95,de_000698,"light gray :: Light gray 44, 45, 46, 45 Light gray absorbs less energy and is better so it does not get dirty.",10,0
96,96,de_000699,light gray :: it must be made with lighter colors so that the temperature level is lower,10,1

185,185,de_000788,white :: less energy is absorbed by the white color. most of the energy is repelled. therefore it is less warm inside the kennel than when black color is used.,10,1
225,225,de_000828,"white :: In summer, the doghouse does not heat up as much as with black paint.  White has the lowest temperature values in the experiment.",10,2

240,240,de_000843,"white :: The darker the paint color, the higher the temperature in the doghouse. This is also reflected in Tim and Jan's experiment. The temperatures in the canning jar are about 10 Â°C higher with a black lid than with a white one.",10,2
