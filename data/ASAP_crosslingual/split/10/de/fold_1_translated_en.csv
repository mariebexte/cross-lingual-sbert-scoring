15,15,de_000618,"white :: The darker the paint color, the warmer the inside of the dog house. A black hutch could get too hot for a dog in the summer. This can be clearly seen in the readings from Tim and Jan's experiment, where the inside temperature of the jar with a black lid is about 53 °C, while the inside temperature with a white lid is only about 42 °C.",10,2
43,43,de_000646,"light gray :: The darker the color, the higher the temperature when exposed to sunlight. However, unlike the glasses, the doghouse is not closed, so the temperature inside does not increase so much. Besides, a metal lid releases the heat quickly and for a short time. Wood stores the heat and releases it over a longer period of time.",10,1
71,71,de_000674,"white :: the thinner the hut, the warmer inside.",10,0
76,76,de_000679,"white :: Close the canning jar using the black lid to which a thermometer is attached. Make sure that the initial temperature in the jar is 24°C. Place the lamp 5 cm from the cap and turn on the lamp. Measure the temperature inside the canning jar after ten minutes and record the temperature as Passage 1. Turn off the lamp and wait for the temperature inside the canning jar to return to the initial temperature. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for passages 2 and 3. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the dark gray, light gray, and white caps. Calculate and record the average air temperature for each cap color.",10,0
89,89,de_000692,"dark gray :: Black 54, 52, 54, 53 There is a darker and colder tone.",10,0
125,125,de_000728,"dark gray :: The dark gray color keeps a constant temperature, for children's rooms this is necessary",10,0
134,134,de_000737,"white :: white color will be more suitable, because it does not affect the temperature like the darker colors the lighter the color becomes less effective as the temperature rises",10,1
168,168,de_000771,"white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.",10,1
178,178,de_000781,"white :: color has effect on the interior temperature, the darker the shade the hotter the interior",10,0
181,181,de_000784,white :: The temperature is different when the sun hits the hut depending on which color you use and how much light it absorbs.,10,0
188,188,de_000791,"white :: according to the mentioned experiments, light colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, preventing them from entering the kennel and increasing the internal temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the kennel.",10,2
194,194,de_000797,white :: the higher the white content the cooler,10,1
202,202,de_000805,"light gray :: The paint color could affect the internal temperature of the doghouse, because the experiment has shown: The darker the color, the warmer it is in the doghouse.  Therefore, in summer, white seems to be better, because it is warm anyway and a dark paint color makes for unbearable temperatures, while in winter, where it is cold, a darker paint color contributes to a pleasantly warm temperature . Therefore, light gray or dark gray seems to me a good compromise.",10,2
209,209,de_000812,white :: the inside of the doghouse will not be heated so much as a result,10,1
216,216,de_000819,"white :: The color black absorbs the light and heat of the environment and transmits them to the air enclosed in the kennel, for which they agree bright colors that reflect the light and heat, so that the dog has a better comfort.",10,1
223,223,de_000826,"white :: Lighter color makes the cottage less heated in the sun, which makes it more comfortable inside in the summer. This is confirmed by the results in the experiment.",10,1
267,267,de_000870,white :: the darker the color the hotter the hut will be,10,0
293,293,de_000896,White :: The color white reflects the light and thus less light energy is converted into heat.,10,1
300,300,de_000903,"Light gray :: The darker the paint, the warmer the doghouse. Now, of course, the question is how warm it is outside and how warm the dog would like. To be on the safe side, let's take a gradation in the middle and none of the extremes.",10,1
