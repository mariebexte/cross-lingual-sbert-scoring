0,199,199,de_000802,"White: The color of the paint affects the temperature of the dog hut. If you use black paint, the temperature rises faster and ends up being higher. If you use white paint, it will remain a little cooler in the dog cabin. In the experiment, there was an average of 11 degrees difference between white and black, so a white paint would be more pleasant for a dog.",10,2
1,184,184,de_000787,"White: The color of the paint affects the interior temperature of the dog hut. According to Tim and Jan's experiment, it should be noted that the darker the paint color, the higher the temperature of the interior of the dog hut.  The best color would be white, as it produces the lowest temperature inside.",10,2
2,242,242,de_000845,"A dog cottage is constantly exposed to the sun. This warms the interior. To avoid excessive heat, the dog hut should be dotted from the outside with a paint that absorbs little heat. The experiment shows that of the tested patches, white colour absorbs the least heat. Thus, white color is best suited for the painting of the dog hut.",10,2
3,52,52,de_000655,"White :: The type of color of the lacquer is crucial for the indoor temperature of the dog hut. White is most suitable for this, as the internal temperature is on average the lowest in contrast to the other colors. This is also demonstrated by the experiment of Tim and Jan.",10,1

5,253,253,de_000856,A dark to black patch could cause the temperature in the dog hut to rise when exposed to sunlight. A bright patch will result in a relatively cash temperature.,10,1
6,150,150,de_000753,"White: Maybe salmon color inside the dog house could also be painted white, so that it absorbs less energy and thus does not heat itself heavily, which would be uncomfortable for the dog. Because we know that white produces the least temperature. If it gets the least heat, it makes sense.",10,1
7,47,47,de_000650,"The darker the patch, the higher the temperature in the dog hut can rise (cf. Experiment Black from 24 to 52-54 degrees more than doubled), such a heated dog hut offers the dog no refuge in the summer.",10,1

9,288,288,de_000891,"White: The experiment has shown that the color of an object can affect the temperature inside an object, so darker colors heat up faster under light exposure. Thus, a dark paint color could increase the temperature inside the cabin.",10,1
