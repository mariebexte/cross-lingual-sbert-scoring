0,210,210,de_000813,"analogous to the experiment, it is likely that one white paint absorbs less energy than the other colors to be selected, thus reducing the increase in air temperature due to radiation. Instead of artificial lighting by a lamp in the experiment, the dog cabin is exposed in reality to the sun, which, however, can expect similar results. In the experiment, it can be seen that the increase in air temperature is the smallest with white cover color compared to the other tested colors (approx. 12°C lower than in the case of black cover after 10 minutes).",10,2
1,285,285,de_000888,"White: The experiment confirmed the boy’s hypothesis. The brighter the color of the cover, the lower the temperature in the glass. Accordingly, the white colour of the dog hut will also help to prevent it from burning up so strongly.",10,2
2,191,191,de_000794,"White :: According to the above experiments, bright colors are recommended because they reflect light and external heat, prevent them from penetrating into the swing and increase the indoor temperature. dark colors absorb light and external heat, resulting in a significant increase in temperature inside the swing.   The recommended swinger is the white.",10,2
