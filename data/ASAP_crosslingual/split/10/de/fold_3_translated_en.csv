47,47,de_000650,"white :: The darker the paint the higher the temperature in the doghouse can rise (cf. experiment black more than doubled from 24 to 52-54 degrees), such a heated doghouse offers the dog no place of retreat in summer.",10,1
49,49,de_000652,"white :: The results confirm the hypothesis made at the beginning: the lighter the paint, the less the air in the doghouse heats up.",10,1
50,50,de_000653,"white :: With black paint color, the interior temperature of the doghouse would be very high in the summer. In winter, the color probably plays a minor role, because there is snow on the hut.",10,0
52,52,de_000655,"white :: The type of paint color is crucial for the internal temperature of the doghouse. White is the most suitable, because the inside temperature is on average the lowest in contrast to the other colors. This is also proven by the experiment of Tim and Jan.",10,1

78,78,de_000681,white :: White color absorbs little energy.,10,0

103,103,de_000706,white :: The darker the paint color is the warmer it will be in the cabin - if the outside temperature is rather cold over the year you should use black. Is the climate moderate rather light/dark gray Is the climate cold it should be black,10,0
150,150,de_000753,"white :: Perhaps salmon paint inside the dog house could also be painted white, so that it absorbs less energy and thus does not heat up much, which would be unpleasant for the dog. Since we know that white gives off the least temperature or heats up the least, that would probably make sense.",10,1
184,184,de_000787,"white :: The paint color affects the inside temperature of the doghouse. According to Tim and Jan's experiment, note that the darker the paint color, the higher the temperature of the inside of the doghouse.  The optimal color would therefore be white, as this gives the lowest temperature inside.",10,2
189,189,de_000792,white :: In the experiment you can observe that the darker the chosen color is a higher heating of the preserving jar can be seen. Therefore I would paint the doghouse white,10,1
199,199,de_000802,"white :: The paint color affects the temperature of the doghouse. If you use black varnish, the temperature rises faster and is also higher at the end. If you use white varnish, it stays a little cooler in the doghouse. In the experiment, according to the average, there was 11 degrees difference between white and black, so a white varnish would be more comfortable for a dog.",10,2
242,242,de_000845,"white :: A dog house is constantly exposed to the sun. This causes the interior to heat up. To avoid too much heat, the doghouse should be painted on the outside with a paint that absorbs little heat. From the experiment, it appears that of the paints tested, white paint absorbs the least amount of heat. Thus, white paint is the most suitable for painting the doghouse.",10,2
253,253,de_000856,white :: A dark to black paint could cause the temperature in the doghouse to rise when exposed to sunlight. A light color paint will result in a relatively constant temperature.,10,1
257,257,de_000860,"white :: The paint color has the effect that the darker the color, the warmer it gets in the doghouse.",10,0
280,280,de_000883,"White :: With all other colors, the temperature in the dog house could rise too much and endanger the health of the animal.",10,1
288,288,de_000891,"White :: The experiment has shown that the color of an object can affect the temperature inside an object, so darker colors heat up faster when exposed to light. So a dark paint color could increase the temperature inside the hut.",10,1
