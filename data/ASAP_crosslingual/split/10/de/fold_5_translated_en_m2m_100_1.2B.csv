0,213,213,de_000816,I would choose the lighter color so it doesn’t get so hot as the experiment says that the dark colors absorb more energy,10,2
1,283,283,de_000886,"White: The experiment showed that a vessel with a white surface is less heated by radiation than a vessel with a different surface. Therefore, the cottage with white paint is likely to be less heated by sunlight. ",10,2
2,245,245,de_000848,"light grey :: The darker the color of the paint, the stronger the temperature will rise in the cabin. Therefore, not black and not dark grey, because in summer the temperatures in the cottage would reach dangerous, harmful heights for the dog. White leads at low temperatures, in particular. In winter, too little heating inside the cottage. Thus, light grey is the best choice, the slight measurement deviations D1, D2, D3 are not significant. Although dark grey is the color that provides the only stable measurement values, reliably absorbed, I consider this color, despite the fairly strong absorption of sun heat and its discharge into the cabin interior such as black, to be health risky for the dog when high outdoor temperatures prevail.",10,2
3,274,274,de_000877,"dark grey :: the darker the color, the warmer the interior becomes when exposed to light. I would take a dark color for the dog so that it doesn't freeze, but not black so that it doesn't get too hot",10,1

5,109,109,de_000712,"black: apparently the temperature in the dog hut increases by 30°C because the color is dark. In white, the temperature, according to the results of the experiment, would only be around. 18 degrees up.",10,1

7,111,111,de_000714,Black: Black is the hottest color because it absorbs the highest amount of light and thus energy and is therefore most convenient for cultivation.,10,1
8,40,40,de_000643,"One clearly recognizes that black leads to a much stronger warming (you know it yourself, if you wear something black in the summer - you sweat there much faster, because, as you have already found out, black absorbs more and therefore it ""under"" becomes warmer. However, it is questionable whether it is just a roof color for large differences (less, but not as in the experiment. It depends on what material the cottage is made of.",10,1
9,25,25,de_000628,"black :: Due to the fact that I chose """"black"""" the dog hut will heat up a little more in the summer. However, this is not a problem, as it generally has an entrance that is always open. Here there is air circulation and the temperature decreases. In winter, on the other hand, a dark color is advantageous because the dog hut does not cool down so quickly.",10,1
10,244,244,de_000847,"It shows that darker colors lead to warming much faster (as seen in the above experiment). Especially when exposed to direct sunlight, colors such as black should warm up very quickly. In the summer, a white cottage is highly recommended. In winter, however, the colour black is likely to keep warm for longer, which is why a darker cabin may be more recommended in winter.",10,1
