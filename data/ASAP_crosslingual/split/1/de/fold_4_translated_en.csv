70,70,de_000071,"The experiment makes sense as described. It would be interesting to see how large the surface area of the samples is in order to better understand the effect of the vinegar. For this purpose, one could calculate the volume of the different samples. Likewise, after the experiment, it must be calculated how ""acid rain"" would have acted on the materials. This would require information on the concentration of vinegar in the acid rain and also on the purity of the vinegar used.",1,2
