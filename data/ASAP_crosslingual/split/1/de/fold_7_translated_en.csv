27,27,de_000028,-The statement that a certain amount of acid rain is added to each container is missing. - It is not specified in what kind of vessel the experiment is carried out -It is missing a conclusion what the experiment should do.,1,1
33,33,de_000034,Pour sufficient vinegar into the containers so that all samples are completely covered with vinegar. The specimens should not be exposed to direct sunlight while drying.,1,0
69,69,de_000070,"The free-floating pollutants settle on buildings. When the pollutants now come into contact with water, they oxidize to sulfuric and nitric acid. The rain that falls has a corresponding acid content due to the free-floating particles.",1,0

108,108,de_000109,"I think it is important to know how much vinegar is in each container at the beginning of the experiment. The amount of water used for rinsing could perhaps also have an effect on the outcome. Last but not least, it is also possible that the vinegar has changed the containers. This should also be considered.",1,2
114,114,de_000115,"The procedure must be repeated, as the destruction will be different materials such as wood and limestone can not absorb moisture during this time. They need a longer interval The composition of the acid rain changes the acidity",1,0

150,150,de_000151,One would need to know exactly what vinegar was used. One would need to know exactly what containers were used. (Plastic? Wood? Metal? etc.) One would have to know if certain distilled water was used.,1,2
158,158,de_000159,"There is too little information about the substances, auxiliaries and additional equipment used. First, the balance would have to be classified more precisely, if only because of measurement inaccuracies. Then the concentration of the vinegar is missing. I would also change the time intervals in the second experiment.",1,1

245,245,de_000246,"1) The respective density value and the volume of the individual sample materials must be specified, since the density of each type of material must be identical when the experiment is repeated, because the degree of decomposition of the respective material by vinegar also depends on the material density. 2) Rinsing time with water and 3) amount of water used must be specified, they must be identical for each material as well as when the experiment is repeated. 3) Quantity of vinegar must be specified and must be identical for each material, 4) All materials must be completely covered by vinegar in the container.",1,3
