138,138,en_cw_000158,"1. I would need to know if the samples where left under clear skies or where kept under roof. Enviromental factors would drastically affect the results.\n 2. If kept outside, it would be good to know the weather conditions of those 24 hours.\n 3. Lastly, was the piece of wood some kind of branch or was it actualli treated wood, with some kind of resin.",1,0
