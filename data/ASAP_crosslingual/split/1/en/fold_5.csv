292,292,en_cw_000322,1. use citric acid\n 2. use piece of soil\n 3. determine visual changes,1,0
210,210,en_cw_000232,The weight of the materials involved in the experiment. You need to know the starting weight to determine the amount of substance you have taken. It would also be important to know the drying temperature.,1,0
42,42,en_cw_000050,plastico marble limestone,1,0
122,122,en_cw_000139,This is strange that pour vinegar contained in Marble and Plastic could change it mass. I don't think it is possible to change their masses even if vinegar is placed for years.,1,0
195,195,en_cw_000217,the mass of departure is subtracted with the final mass and the result is the difference in mass,1,0
219,219,en_cw_000243,Well they could have done the procedure if they waited 24 hours since it was not necessary to wait so long,1,0

300,300,en_cw_000330,we know formula of vinegar and also a solution contain in conainer then we subtract into it\n then also find percentage error,1,0

93,93,en_cw_000106,1. Record the temperature to check if temperature could affect the result\n 2. Check the pH (the acid degree) and try with some other liquid acid\n 3. Mentioning if the container is closed with lid or not to check if the reaction with air can make the result different.,1,1
