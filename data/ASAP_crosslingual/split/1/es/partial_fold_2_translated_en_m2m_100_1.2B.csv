Because if not, it should have absorbed more liquid and therefore increased its mass since that is one of the characteristics of wood. I don’t think 30 minutes was enough for the wood to evaporate the liquid and I should have seen more difference. On the other hand, it would have been more interesting if they did the experiment using samples that had the initial mass. This makes it easier to compare results. Finally, it is important to clean the samples since the use of vinegar will surely ""clean"" the samples from debris and therefore there is a difference after leaving to dry.",1,1
