Initially, we could use elements such as cardboard, icopor, glass and brick to take samples that we can put in test tubes (they are cheap) to which we would add vinegar in order not to change the liquid with which the experiment is being done or put other liquids such as soda, cleaning liquids (clorox-bleach) and rainwater to know the different effects of these liquids in each material. It is also important to have the elements for the measurement of the samples to be used and thus have the initial data and the final data. It would be advisable to perform this experiment in a place where nobody can move it and where the temperature does not have a major variation so that the samples are always stable and there is no major effect on it when the results are reviewed. This procedure, as can be seen in the previous experiment, must be built and left for 24 hours so that the liquid has an effect on the material being tested. I would add data such as: Resistance of the material.",1,0
