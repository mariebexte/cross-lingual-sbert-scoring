Initially it could use elements such as cardboard, icopor, glass and brick to take samples that we can put in test tubes (they are economical) to which we would add vinegar in order not to change the liquid with which the experiment is being carried out or put other liquids such as soda, cleaning liquids (clorox-bleach) and rainwater to know the different effects of these liquids on each material. It is also important that you have elements for the measurement of the samples that will be used and thus have the initial data and the final data This experiment would be recommended to do it in a ligar where no one can move it and that the temperature does not have greater variation so that the samples are always stable and there is no greater effect on it when the results are reviewed. This procedure, as can be seen in the previous experiment, must be constructed and left for 24 hours so that the liquid has an effect on the material being tested.\n\nI would add data such as:\n* Resistance of the material\n*Group to which the material belongs\n*Liquid used",1,0
