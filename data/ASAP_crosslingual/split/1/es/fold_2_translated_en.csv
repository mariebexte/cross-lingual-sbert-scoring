Because if not, it should have absorbed more liquid and therefore increased its mass since that is one of the characteristics of wood. I don't think 30 minutes was long enough for the wood to evaporate the liquid and I should have seen more difference. On the other hand, it would have been more interesting to do the experiment using samples having the same initial mass. This way, it is easier to compare the results. Finally, it is important to clean the samples since the use of vinegar probably ""cleaned"" the samples of debris and that is why there is a difference after drying.",1,1
