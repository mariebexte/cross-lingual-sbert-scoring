3,112,112,es_3D4CH1LGEC604I04LEON43WV7UD9GF,"Acid rainAcid rain is a form of acid pollution, which refers to the fall (deposition) of acids present in the atmosphere through rain, fog and snow (also known as wet deposition). nThe main precursors of acids are sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are emitted by thermoelectric power plants, internal combustion engines of cars and airplanes, and some other industries, as a product of the combustion of fuels containing small percentages of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N), such as coal, natural gas, gas oil, petroleum, etc. nAcids, mainly sulfuric acid and nitric acid, dissolve in the water droplets that form clouds and in the raindrops themselves, and are deposited on the ground. Both acids originate in the atmosphere when sulfur trioxide (SO3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) react with water, oxygen and other chemicals present. In the presence of sunlight, the rate of most of these reactions increases.nThere is also another form of acid pollution known as dry deposition, which refers to acidic gases and particles that are carried by the wind, hitting buildings, cars, houses and trees. Another way of entrainment is heavy rainfall. In this case acidic substances are incorporated into acid rain, which contributes to its acidity.nApproximately half of the acidic substances in the atmosphere fall to the ground through dry deposition processes.nHow is acid rain measured?nAcid rain is measured on the ""pH"" scale, hydrogen potential. The lower the pH of a substance, the more acidic it is.nPure water has a pH of 7.0 and rain normally has a pH between 5 and 6, i.e., it is slightly acidic, carrying carbonic acid that forms when carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in the falling water. On the other hand, in areas where the atmosphere is polluted by these acidifying substances, the rain has pH values of up to 4 or 3 and, in some areas where the fog is acidic, the pH can reach 2 or 3, i.e. similar to that of lemon juice or vinegar.nWhat are the effects of acid rain? nThe effects caused by acidic water will depend on several factors, such as the degree of acidity of the water, the chemical composition of the soil and its buffering capacity, as well as the characteristics of the living organisms affected.nAcid deposition contributes to the lowering of pH in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and allows the mobilization of toxic metals, especially aluminum. This causes a variety of effects, such as damage to forests and soils, fish and other living things, building materials and human health. Acid rain also acts to reduce visibility.n In forests, acid rain causes damage by decomposing soil nutrients, hindering the natural growth of trees. The damage can extend to prairie grasses, harming livestock, and to lakes, potentially killing large numbers of fish.n The effects of acid rain on soil can be magnified in high mountain forests, where fog contributes significant amounts of acid pollutants.n Acid rain contributes to the degradation of building and art materials (stone disease) and metal corrosion. Monuments and buildings are sensitive to the action of acid rain. Many ruins have disappeared or are about to disappear because of this factor.nHarm to people is mainly indirect, through the consumption of fish and drinking water contaminated by acid rain.nHow can acid rain be reduced? nTo reduce acid rain, it is necessary to reduce the emission of the chemical compounds that give rise to acids, i.e., acid precursors, which are mainly sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (nitrogen monoxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2). Today, SO2 formation can be reduced by removing sulfur from fossil fuels or by trapping SOx before it is emitted into the atmosphere, through chemical reactions that transform it into less reactive chemical species. The use of catalytic converters reduces the formation of NO and NO2 by reducing these oxides to N2 and O2.",1,0
