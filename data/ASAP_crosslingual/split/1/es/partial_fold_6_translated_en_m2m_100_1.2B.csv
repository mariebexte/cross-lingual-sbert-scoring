Using seven precipitated glasses, materials such as cloth, rubber, cardboard, glass, aluminum, stone and ceramics can be added inside. They are labeled, vinegar is added and sealed. Leave to remove for 42 hours. After 42 hours, use distilled water to rinse the materials and then let them dry completely. With a scientific balance measure the weight of the materials again and add the data to a table. Calculate the difference between masses (g).",1,0
