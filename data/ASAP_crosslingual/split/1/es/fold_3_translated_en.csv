I would also need the time of day where the samples were placed with vinegar, I believe that whether it was night or day, there would be a difference between the measurements as they can be affected by temperature. Also, I would also need to know the season in which the experiment was carried out, difference in temperature can make a major change during the experiment.",1,2
