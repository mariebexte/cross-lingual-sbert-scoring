31,31,fr_010032,"The mass of substance decreased after the experiment.The limestone, when it reacts with the vinegar, dissolves pieces of a material called calcium carbonate in the limestone. This releases carbon dioxide, a gas that rises to the surface as a stream of bubbles, it reduces the mass of limestone.Bios is not an acid, so it does not react with vinegar",1,1
42,42,fr_010043,"Standardize and document the experimental protocols,Increase the transparency of the data and statistics,Indeed, you have to make modifications to the experiment to reproduce the data, always with the aim of obtaining the same results",1,0
43,43,fr_010044,"the mass of the objects can be measured with specific equipment after _30 minutes of waiting, it is necessary to add reagents so that the mass can be calculated if some substances such as oxen",1,0
44,44,fr_010045,"1) Make sure that each sample size is the same. 2) Find out what the real purpose of the experiment is, to know the best method of experimentation. 3) Find out exactly how much vinegar is needed for each sample.",1,2
46,46,fr_010047,The wood sample should show no change in mass.  Vinegar is an excellent product for cleaning lime deposits.  Do not clean plastic containers with vinegar because of corrosion residue.,1,0
50,50,fr_010051,I would need to know the equipment that was used to take the mass and measurements. I need to know the type of vinegar. I want to know the drying environment,1,3
69,69,fr_010070,Different is very huge and this data is very essential. The mass of end is less than the mass of defert. That all the tables are equal points. This is a very interesting table.,1,0
117,117,fr_010118,The initial and final mass of the samples was given.,1,1
128,128,fr_010129,6-1 add dye to add color 6-2 add salt to taste and last 6-3 add wheat flour to add bulk,1,0
170,170,fr_010171,"Data on ambient temperature, specific heat of each material and their average life are needed.",1,2
172,172,fr_010173,I would need the volume of vinegar poured into each container.,1,1
174,174,fr_010175,I think you should add a little more vinegar and waiting time for marble and limestone,1,0
179,179,fr_010180,"The purpose of the experiment should be explained, for example: To determine the mass of four different material samples before and after being exposed to vinegar. The samples should be weighed initially and their weight noted. After the procedure is performed, a report with the conclusion should be made.",1,2
202,202,fr_010203,"I would need to know what is used as a sample. I would also need to know how we measure the samples. Finally, I would need to understand what the overall assumption was to interpret the table.",1,2
204,204,fr_010205,I would like to know the weather at the time of the experiment. The weather would specifically affect the results. I would like to know the density of the plastic as it would probably expand. I would like to know how many times this procedure was repeated to check for any calculation errors.,1,3
222,222,fr_010223,4. Store the samples in a location with the appropriate temperature and humidity for each sample. 7. Repeat step 6 three times for best accuracy.  8. Determine the percentage error of the sample weighing process.,1,0
246,246,fr_010247,"7.Create a table with the columns of sample name, starting mass, ending mass, and mass difference in grams 8.Put the mass data before design in the second column and after design in the third column 9. In the fourth column, subtract the starting mass values from the ending mass in grams.",1,0
251,251,fr_010252,The table is a smaller difference for each column. This is a very interesting table. And marble and wood have only a smaller difference so the column and table are very interesting.,1,0
253,253,fr_010254,"First of all, I would make an assumption. Second, I would point out if the issue is undergoing a physical change? Finally, I would also make sure to repeat the experiment.",1,1
