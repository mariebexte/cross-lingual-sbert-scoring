It is also necessary to have a dry final sample before weighing to ensure that the sample does not contain any more liquid, thus distorting the mass measurement. In step three it would have been useful to specify that the containers in question are in fact the containers previously prepared with vinegar. Finally, a list of the equipment needed for the experiment would be useful (precision balance, type of container, tongs, etc.) as well as the substances (what type of vinegar) and materials used.",1,0
