It is also necessary to have a final sample dry well before weighing to ensure that the sample does not contain any more liquid, thereby distorting the measurement of the mass. It will also be necessary to be careful not to degrade a sample that has become fragile before weighing by handling it with caution.In step three it would have been useful to specify that the containers in question are actually the containers previously prepared with vinegar. Finally, a list of the material needed for the experiment would be useful (precision balance, type of container, pince...) as well as the subtans (which type of vinegar) and materials used.",1,0
