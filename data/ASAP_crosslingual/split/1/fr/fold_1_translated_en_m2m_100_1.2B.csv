0,204,204,fr_010205,I would like to know the weather at the time of the experience. The jumidite would specifically affect the results. I would like to know the density of the plastic because it would probably dilate. I would like to know how many times this procedure has been repeated to check for any calculation errors.,1,3
1,50,50,fr_010051,I would need to know the equipment that was used to take the Mass and measurements. I need to know the type of vinegar. I want savior what the surroundings of sechage are,1,3
2,46,46,fr_010047,The wood sample must show no change in mass.  Vinegar is an excellent product for cleaning limestone deposits.  Do not clean plasticized containers with vinegar due to residues of corrosion.,1,0
3,69,69,fr_010070,The difference is very huge and this data is very important. The final mass is lower than the defert mass. All tables are equal points. This is a very interesting table.,1,0
4,222,222,fr_010223,4 is Store the samples in a place with the appropriate temperature and humidity for each sample.  7 is Repeat step 6 three times for better accuracy.  8 is Determine the error percentage of the sample weighing process.,1,0
5,128,128,fr_010129,6-1 add coloring to add color 6-2 add salt to taste and last 6-3 add wheat flour to add volume,1,0
6,42,42,fr_010043,"Standardize and document experimental protocols, Increase data and statistics transparency,Indeed, you need to make changes to the experiment to reproduce the data, always with the aim of obtaining the same results",1,0
7,174,174,fr_010175,I think you should add a little more vinegar and wait time for marble and limestone,1,0
8,251,251,fr_010252,The table is a smaller difference for each column. This is a very interesting picture. And marble and wood only have a smaller difference so the column and table are very interesting.,1,0
9,43,43,fr_010044,"the mass of objects can be measured with a specific equipment after _30 minutes of waiting, it is necessary to add reagents so that the mass can be calculated if certain substances such as beef",1,0
10,246,246,fr_010247,"Create a table with the columns of the sample name, starting mass, end mass and mass difference in grams. 8 is Enter the mass data before the design in the second column and after the design in the third column 9. In the fourth column, subtract the starting mass values from the final mass in grams.",1,0
11,172,172,fr_010173,I would need the amount of vinegar poured into each container.,1,1
12,253,253,fr_010254,"First, I would make a hypothesis. Secondly, would I point out if the question is undergoing a physical change? I would also like to repeat the experience.",1,1
13,31,31,fr_010032,"The mass of the substance decreased after the experiment.the limestone, when it reacts with vinegar, dissolves pieces of a material called calcium carbonate in the limestone. This releases carbon dioxide, a gas that rises to the surface in the form of a bubble flow, it reduces the limestone mass.Bios is not an acid, so it does not react with vinegar",1,1
14,117,117,fr_010118,The initial and final mass of the samples was given.,1,1
15,170,170,fr_010171,"Data on ambient temperature, the specific heat of each material and their average lifetime are required.",1,2
16,179,179,fr_010180,"The purpose of the experiment must be explained, for example: Determining the mass of four samples of different materials before and after being exposed to vinegar. The samples must be initially weighed and their weight noted. After the procedure is carried out, a report with the conclusion should be made.",1,2
17,44,44,fr_010045,"1) Make sure each sample size is the same. 2) Find out what is the real goal of the experiment, to know the best method of experimentation. 3) Find out exactly how much vinegar is needed for each sample.",1,2
18,202,202,fr_010203,"I would need to know what is used as a sample. I would also need to know how we measure the samples. Finally, I would need to understand what the overall hypothesis was to interpret the picture.",1,2
