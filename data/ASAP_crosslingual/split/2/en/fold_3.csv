Should repeat trial for more times because some value is close, like the stretched amount of type A and C. 2. Should keep the shape and volume and mass of the plastic samples all the same. 3. Change the weight of weights and do the trial again.",2,3

193,193,en_cw_000544,"I would conclude that some plastics are more elastic than others. \n The students could improve the experiment by using the same size plastics to start with, same length and width. They could also add a step to see how much the plastic shrunk once the clamps and weights were removed. I also would question why Type C actually shrank.",2,2

79,79,en_cw_000421,According to what can be observed in the description the student wanted to measure the malleability and the ability to yield the plastic. Of course depending on the density and quality of the plastic material will influence its etiramiento. I would recommend the application of a greater weight.,2,0
