58,58,en_cw_000400,I can conclude that diferent types of plastics have diferent stretchability.\n \n it is necessary for the student to provide the initial measurement of each sample.\n it is necessary repeat de experiment a larger number of times to take a average.,2,3
94,94,en_cw_000437,"Sample A was the one with the highest stretchability (10%). Sample D did not register any stretchability. Samples B and C also have stretchability. \n \n \n For the results to be valid and to be able to compare them, the length and width of each plastic sample must be the same. Another recommendation is that the weight on the bottom edge of the plastic sample should be the same.",2,2
16,16,en_cw_000347,"The experiment concludes that not all the plastics reacts in same manner. Depending on which type of polymers are used on each sample we can get different results.\n The experiments might be improved using the same forces on each sample, and knowing the weight of the elements added to the clamps to make strength.",2,2

91,91,en_cw_000433,Plastic type D stretches the most. They could have made sure to hang the weights only for a specific amount of time and used the same time each round of stetching. They should have made sure that the clamps all weighed exactly the same so as to not make the results invalid.,2,0

164,164,en_cw_000513,"I think that's not much probability of plastic C has less mm after streched, unless it has been broken. The plastic A is the more streachble.\n In my opinion the student must calculate a percentage of strechability and do the mean of the two experiments. I will also like the experiment to have 3 repetitions instead of 2.",2,1
216,216,en_cw_000571,good we can see that the plastic can reach stretch little or a lot or nothing depending on the material of the plastic.\n is valid because it is experienced with a weight to slightly force the length of the plastic,2,1
31,31,en_cw_000368,"in general the plastics tend to elongate as we can see in the results the type a and b are lengthened, the c is usually shortened and the d remains the same.\n the student was able to improve the procedure by doing more times the procedure with the same type of material to see if the same thing always happens and if the same thing is always extended.\n can also make the clamp last longer with the weight to see if the plastic is deformed more or not",2,1
188,188,en_cw_000539,a) Something is wrong because the sample C is shorter after the experiment.\n b) The student should say the mass for the weight,2,1
