56,56,en_cw_000397,some types of plastic stretched more than others. Make sure the weight and size of each piece of plastic is uniform. Make pieces of tape uniform insize and shape,2,3
4,4,en_cw_000335,The amount of weight added to the types\n The initial length of the types\n The amount of tape put on each type,2,2
222,222,en_cw_000577,"It depends on what the plastic is. I can't determine what the conclusion is based on the data without additional information. The validity could be improved if the length of the plastic was given so we can tell what the beginning length was. Perhaps a shorter piece of plastic would stretch farther. During the second trial, why was there a disparity?",2,2
133,133,en_cw_000480,How much weight do i have to add in total?\n How much weight is needed for each step of load?\n Does the length of plastic samples have to be the same?,2,2
7,7,en_cw_000338,"at first glance, according to the results, the first sample is more elastic. he was able to improve the results by adding equal weights to each sample and using samples of the same length",2,2
270,270,en_cw_000628,Plastic type A is may be thin and has more elasticity . Plastic type B is thicker than type A and Type C has more elasticity than all type and that is may be recycle standard and D has no elasticity and it remains same .,2,0
109,109,en_cw_000453,all the options proposed are ideal for work,2,0
289,289,en_cw_000649,Explaining a possible expected results before the experiment had been conceived. The results could had variation in percentage for the initial and final stage of the polymers.,2,0
74,74,en_cw_000416,we see that after many attempts procedure stabilize the amount of stretched plastic. I think here will be better a graphic parabola grafic to discribe the complexity of the process.,2,0
46,46,en_cw_000384,a. most plastics have the property of elongation when they are forced for excesive weight\n b. Using different kind of polymeres not just plastic and showing the exact weight used for calculation purposes.,2,0
230,230,en_cw_000588,"It makes no sense that D2 value in C is less than D1, so there must be something wrong with the data. The experiment should say how much should be the mass of the weights used in the experiment.",2,0
244,244,en_cw_000602,a,2,0
33,33,en_cw_000370,"Plastic type C was the most stretchable from the other, getting more stretched by the weights added to it. Another way he could to do this investigation, is putting some weight above each polymer plastics type for a specific time, the one that gets more little than the other ones is the most stretchable polymer plastic type.",2,0
241,241,en_cw_000599,Leave the weights a few more minutes.,2,0
218,218,en_cw_000573,"Take a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length.\n Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it is hanging freely down the side of the table.\n Attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample.\n Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.",2,0
232,232,en_cw_000590,the experiment shows that different plastic materials are stretched differently by the same added weight. \n the plastic sample have to be securely clamped to the edge of the table rather than taping it,2,1
135,135,en_cw_000482,Not all plants are elongated and requires a greater force than gravity to elongate all plastics,2,1
141,141,en_cw_000488,"1. Shape of samples: different shapes present different characteristics.\n 2. Weigth added, this is needed in order to know if any sample was brought to a weight where it actually deforms insted of stretch.\n 3. Not sure if really relevant but the time the weight was applied should be known, some plastics have higher resistance but still stretch slowly.",2,1
60,60,en_cw_000402,"plastic is practically not plastic (not tensile under load). for more accurate conclusions, it is necessary to increase the length of the samples.",2,1
