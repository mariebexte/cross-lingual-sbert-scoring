162,162,en_cw_000510,a. Conclusion: The type of polymer plastics influence in its stretchability.\n b. He needs to put on the table: The type of polymers and the initial and final measures.,2,2
276,276,en_cw_000634,a. Assuming that the starting length of the samples is equal plastic type B seems the type that has stretched the most without returning to its previous form.\n b. Assure that the starting length of the materials is the same. Measure the length of the material with the clamp and weights on it so you can measure the maximum stretchability before it returns to its original form.,2,2
12,12,en_cw_000343,"a. The plastics have varying levels of stretch/elasticity. From least stretch to most: A, C, D, B.\n b. Does not state if the width or thickness of plastic was measured, these would need to be uniform across the plastic types for valid conclusions to be drawn.",2,2
116,116,en_cw_000460,"a. The plastic that stretched the most was A (20%), followed by C (7.14%) and B (4.5%), the D did not stretch.\n b. The same length must be defined for all samples. You must specify the weight that is added, which must be the same for everyone. You can try different weights and varying times.",2,2

First, they could measure the length of plastic without removing the weight and clamps. Second, they could calculate the percentage of change, that way they would have a better point of view of how each plastic could change in those conditions.",2,1
200,200,en_cw_000553,"a. Conclusion is that Plastic type A has stretched the most and plastic type D has stretched the least\n b:\n 1. Start with equal lengths of plastic\n 2: Clamp the plastic at the non weighted end so that there is no bend, which would be caused by hanging from the table. This will ensure there is no weak point which could cause extra stretching",2,1
