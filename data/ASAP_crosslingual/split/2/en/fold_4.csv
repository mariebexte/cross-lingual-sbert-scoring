201,201,en_cw_000554,The conclusion is that the elastic materials will extend according to their nomenclature or resistance. \n 1.- could expose them some type of greater resistance. \n 2.- place them in different environments. \n 3.- place them for much longer,2,1
233,233,en_cw_000591,A conclusion would be that plastic can stretch when adding weight to one end.\n A way to improve the experiment would be to run the test on additional samples of each plastic piece used.\n This would make sure that it was not a fluke but could be repeated with the same results.\n Using tape at the top of the plastic sounds like it could not really be stabilized. The weights affecting the plastic could differ the results depending on how well the plastic was secured.,2,1
