0,61,61,fr_020062,"Based on the data, one conclusion is that the type of material affects stretching. Students could improve experimental design by performing more tests and using more materials.",2,3
1,23,23,fr_020024,Plastic type A is the most stretched. The experience could be improved by testing multiple strips of the same plastic.,2,2
2,24,24,fr_020025,"Do a _3th test, use decimal for measurement, use different weights, let hang for a longer period of time",2,2
3,74,74,fr_020075,"The first method: Install the plastic parts from the upper end and hang in the suspended end of the plastic a weight so that we do the same for all the plastic parts and leave them for a while then we measure.  The second way: we apply similar forces on both sides to each piece of plastic and leave it fixed for a while, then we measure the pieces.",2,2
4,43,43,fr_020044,"Basically, the student noticed that different types of plastics have different types of elasticity. If I were the student, I would test the plastics without the weight and notice the real deformation it would cause.",2,2

7,17,17,fr_020018,(a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). (b)Please the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it is suspended freely on the side of the table.,2,0
8,81,81,fr_020082,Add weights to the pince and let them hang for five minutes.,2,0

10,37,37,fr_020038,"We can use a glass plate instead of plastic, so the result may be correct.",2,0
11,151,151,fr_020152,"The student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results is that the exercise is too good for the students, I am impressed, by the way in which they have improved a lot in both physical condition and physical and mental fitness.",2,0
12,137,137,fr_020138,"a) Remove the weights and pince, and measure the length of the plastic types..Make a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1).b)Please the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it is freely suspended on the side of the table.",2,0
13,0,0,fr_020001,Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1).  b) Stick the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it can freely hang on the side of the table.,2,0

15,25,25,fr_020026,The plastic samples were stretching because of the weights attached to them.,2,1
16,30,30,fr_020031,"Obviously, it wasnâ€™t exactly the same thing both times, because there are different results. They should have taken more steps to ensure that the experience was exactly the same as the first time. Maybe to film it?",2,1
17,165,165,fr_020166,The test is not over. More accurate data is needed and a weight is needed to determine the actual stretch capacity.,2,1
18,66,66,fr_020067,Repeat the procedure exactly for the three remaining plastic samples.,2,1
