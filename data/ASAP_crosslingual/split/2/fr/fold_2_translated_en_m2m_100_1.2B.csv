1,109,109,fr_020110,"A. There are different types of plastic, which results in larger data volumes. Students can learn about the different types of plastic. And the student could also share the weight of each plastic.",2,2
2,184,184,fr_020185,"The student had received roughly the same results twice completing the experiment. For this reason, I would have completed the experiment a third time. I would also have made an assumption at the beginning of my research.",2,2
3,126,126,fr_020127,A. Plastic type B had the most stretch.    The student could have improved the experimental design by attaching a pince to the two ends of the samples and separating them to test the stretch. The student can also stretch them without the weights.,2,2
4,97,97,fr_020098,"Based on the information, we can see that type D plastic stretches more in millimeters. The student can improve the experience in two ways: have a control and see if ambient temperature affects stretching.",2,2
5,95,95,fr_020096,"This type of diagram is based on the type of plastic. This type of tables is very interesting.It is separated by the whole amount based. This is separated in two ways: T_1 and T2. T1 has 10,22,14,20 numbers in their column. And T2 has 12,23,13,20 numbers in this column. Overall, this is a very interesting table.",2,0

7,90,90,fr_020091,a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b) Stick the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it can freely hang on the side of the table.,2,0
8,11,11,fr_020012,A student has performed _1 surveys followed by testing,2,0
9,108,108,fr_020109,"If they continue to practice as step one, they can improve.",2,0
10,176,176,fr_020177,Student data provides the test result of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the rigidity of the structure and the weight of the polymer.,2,0
11,120,120,fr_020121,The studentâ€™s design was wonderful.,2,0
12,54,54,fr_020055,The second test will be different.,2,0
13,41,41,fr_020042,Student data provides the test result of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the rigidity of the structure and the weight of the polymer.,2,0
14,96,96,fr_020097,"(a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1), (b)Please the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it is freely suspended on the side of the table.",2,0
15,119,119,fr_020120,have specified the type of plastic and photos or videos of the experiment,2,1
16,182,182,fr_020183,and a. The student result seems inaccurate because T_1 and T2 results differ from each other despite the same process. The results of both tests should be the same.         The student must have paid the same attention and applied the same energy in both tests.,2,1
17,135,135,fr_020136,Plastic polymer B is shown a quantity ethered longer than others,2,1
18,80,80,fr_020081,"Take a sample of a type of plastic and measure its length and remove the weights and pince, and measure the length of the types of plastic.",2,1
