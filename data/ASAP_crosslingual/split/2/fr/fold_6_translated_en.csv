2,2,fr_020003,The student has been outperformed.,2,0
5,5,fr_020006,the experiment is very good and the students make it better.,2,0
26,26,fr_020027,one. Plastic D seemed to be the most stable b. He could use other types of plastic and also collect more data from the experiment for further analysis,2,2
27,27,fr_020028,The student was successful,2,0
29,29,fr_020030,"a. From the first and second rows of data, it appears that the lengths increased. However, the last two rows of data appear to be wrong. The lengths of the T_2 experiments must be greater than those of the T1 experiments. b. One is that the student can attach weight to both sides using a pulley. To validate the results, the student can experiment with different initial lengths and show an elasticity constant.",2,2
34,34,fr_020035,a. The first test produced greater length differences when adding clips to the plastic during. b.A comparison chart would have been helpful of the before/after results and the two different studies.,2,1
36,36,fr_020037,a. the plastic hardly stretches at all. b. the student could have pulled the plastic himself. the student could have used a machine.,2,1
42,42,fr_020043,Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1).,2,0
57,57,fr_020058,"a.The amount of stretch of the plastic types varies from _10 to 25 mm. Both type A and C plastics are between 10 and 13 mm in length only, while the amount of type D plastic was found to be the same at 20 mm. Type B plastic has the maximum amount of 22-23 mm in the results. b.The student could have used the different techniques for each method and then could have repeated the procedure by changing T1 to T2 and T2 to T1 so that the results were a little more accurate.",2,2

89,89,fr_020090,The student successfully,2,0
118,118,fr_020119,a).make a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)glue the upper edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.,2,0
123,123,fr_020124,THE STRONGEST SAMPLE IS D. THE STUDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ACCURATE BY USING AN APPROPRIATE MEASURING DEVICE FOR ELASTICITY AND STRENGTH OF MATERIALS.,2,2
125,125,fr_020126,1)The length of the plastic should be measured when the lamp is attached to the plastic 2)The initial length of all the plastic samples should be the same before the experiment starts,2,1

139,139,fr_020140,a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.,2,0
157,157,fr_020158,Type B plastic is more elastical,2,1
169,169,fr_020170,"The data shows that plastic B stretched the most being _22 mm T1 and 23 mm T2.  The students could have improved the experiment if they had done one more trial also they could have been more precise in the procedure for example, they should have told you how much weight you add to the plastic",2,3
