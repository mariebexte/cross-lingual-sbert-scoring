0,53,53,fr_020054,"Plastic A showed a big difference between T_1 and T2, showing that more experiments are needed to determine a more accurate measurement and error. Other plastics showed more precise measurements, where plastic B proved to be the most deformed plastic in the experiment.  To improve the experience, the same process should be repeated at least 5 times, for greater accuracy. Finally, another way to improve the results would be to conduct experiments on two or three people so that there is more than one person checking the experimental process.",2,3

It seems strange to get a smaller plastic with the C after this experiment, and with the D not changing. To improve the validity of the results, I would have opted for a _3th test in order to have more data to compare. Then draw a conclusion.",2,2

6,63,63,fr_020064,"Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW), including valuable materials such as plastics, has a remarkable impact on the waste sector. In order for plastics to be reused, they must be identified and separated according to their polymer composition. In this study, the identification of these materials was carried out using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which identified the material according to their physico-chemical properties. The advantages of the NIR method are low environmental impact and rapid measurement (in seconds) in the spectral range of _1600-2400 nm without special sample preparation. The limitations include his inability to analyze dark materials. The identified polymers have been used as components for the wood-polymer composite (WPC), which consists of a polymer matrix, low-cost loads and additives. The components were first made up of an aggregation device, followed by extrusion production. In the agglomeration process, the goal was to compose all materials to produce uniformly distributed and granulated materials in the form of granules. During the agglomeration process, the polymer (matrix) was melted and the loads and other additives were then mixed into the melted polymer, being ready for the extrusion process. In the extrusion method, heat and cutting forces were applied to a material inside the cannon of a rotating double-wire conic extruder, which reduces the risk of burning materials and reducing cutting mixture. The mixture heated and cisa cisa was then transmitted through a matrix to give the product the desired shape. The protocol described above has proven the potential for reuse of CDW materials. Functional properties must be verified according to standardised tests, such as flexural, tensile and impact resistance tests for the material.  I is",2,0
