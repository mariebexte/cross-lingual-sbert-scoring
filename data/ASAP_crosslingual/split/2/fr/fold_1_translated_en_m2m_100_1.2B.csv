1,103,103,fr_020104,"There are a number of ways to improve the validity of an experiment, including by controlling more variables, improving the measurement technique, increasing randomization to reduce sample bias, blinding the experiment, and adding control groups or placebo.   Control more variables is to ensure that as few things as possible change over the course of the experiment.  An ideal experience is one where a thing is changed and a result is examined.  Everything else must remain the same.  So, for example, if you wanted to know how fast balls of different masses would roll over a particular hill, you would change the mass of the ball and keep everything else the same.  You would keep the material of the ball, the release point, the place of measurement, a method, the humidity of the air, the height above sea level and everything you can think of in the same way.  The more you keep the same, the more likely it is that your result will be valid.   The measurement technique can also be improved.  Per instead of measuring something by hand, you could use a computer and an electronic sensor.  Or maybe instead of asking one person to measure the results, you could ask several people to take measurements and compare their responses.   Increasing randomization is a way to reduce a particular validity problem: sample bias.  This is when the samples studied are not a representative sample of the population.  For example, let’s say that your tests for the effect of a drug and your tests mainly contain white men between _20 and 30 years of age.  This would not be a good sample due to the lack of extent, age and gender. Or maybe you’re testing weight loss medications on people who already have a healthy weight.  Increasing sample randomization will reduce this problem.",2,2
2,86,86,fr_020087,Students concluded that plastic B is the most elastic. Students could improve their performance using hardness: a measurement of a material’s resistance to deformation under a concentrated compression load and tenacity: a measurement of a material’s energy absorption capacity during impacts.,2,2

7,10,10,fr_020011,"Plastics and rubber are made up of polymers made up of smaller units called monomers, which bind (polymerize) into long chains. Currently, the vast majority of monomers are produced from oil (oil/mineral oil) and are therefore not renewable. Monomers can also be made from biomass, but usually at a higher cost. Outside monomers, various additives are added to the process of making plastics and rubber. Additives are chemicals that are necessary for the polymerization process properly, or give the final product its desired specificity properties, for example, plastics, flame retardants, thermal and UV stabilizers, biocides, pigments, diluents, etc. Polymers are large in size, which means they do not penetrate biological membranes and are not reactive and are therefore not considered to be toxic. On the contrary, monomers that have not reacted, solvents, additives or degradation products, can leak and be exposed to both humans and the environment during the entire life cycle of a product. Many common additives are classified as hazardous according to the EU Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and mixtures (CLP)_1There are a large number of hazardous chemicals in plastics present in consumer products. It is relatively little known for the majority of these chemicals how they affect our health and the environment, but some phthalates, bisphenol A, some bromated flame retardants and polyfluoride chemicals, have been relatively well studied and are therefore at the heart of this report. These chemicals have a negative impact on humans and the environment, and research has shown that a large proportion of the population is constantly exposed to them. When chemicals are discarded by building products or materials in a house, the dust acts as a chemical well that reflects all the chemicals that can be exposed at home. Contaminated dust will be inhaled or eaten, as it finds on food, accumulates in the mucous membranes of the mouth, or when children put dusty fingers and objects into their mouths.",2,0
