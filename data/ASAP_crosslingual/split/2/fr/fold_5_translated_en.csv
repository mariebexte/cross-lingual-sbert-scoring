0,0,fr_020001,a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1). b) Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.,2,0
17,17,fr_020018,a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1).b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.,2,0
23,23,fr_020024,Type A plastic is the most stretched. The experiment could be improved by testing multiple strips of the same plastic.,2,2
24,24,fr_020025,"Perform a _3rd test, use decimals for measurement, use different weights, let it hang for a longer period of time",2,2
25,25,fr_020026,The plastic samples stretched because of the weights attached to them.,2,1
30,30,fr_020031,"a. Obviously, it wasn't exactly the same both times because there are different results. b. They should have taken more measurements to make sure the experiment was exactly the same as the first time. Maybe film it?",2,1
37,37,fr_020038,we can use a glass plate instead of plastic its makes the result chane..this may be correct,2,0
43,43,fr_020044,"a - Basically, the student noticed that different types of plastics have different types of elasticity. b - If I were the student, I would test the plastics without the weight and notice the true deformation it would cause.",2,2
61,61,fr_020062,"Based on the data, one conclusion is that the type of material affects the stretch. Students could improve the experimental design by conducting more tests and using more materials.",2,3
66,66,fr_020067,Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.,2,1
74,74,fr_020075,"The first way: Install the plastic pieces from the upper end and hang in the suspended end of the plastic a weight so that we do the same for all the plastic pieces and leave them for a while and then we measure.  The second way: we apply similar forces on both sides to each piece of plastic and leave it fixed for some time, then we measure the pieces.",2,2
81,81,fr_020082,Add weights to the clamp and let them hang for five minutes.,2,0
83,83,fr_020084,The student has been outdone.,2,0
115,115,fr_020116,I need a calculator and measuring instruments,2,0
137,137,fr_020138,"a) Remove the weights and the clamp, and measure the length of the types of plastic.Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1) .b)Glue the upper edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.",2,0
151,151,fr_020152,"the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is the exercise too good for the students, I am impressed, by how much they improved in both physical and mental state.",2,0
161,161,fr_020162,Content analysis of the media,2,0
163,163,fr_020164,Describe two ways in which the studentfunctions the data,2,0
165,165,fr_020166,the test is not complete. more accurate data is needed and a weight to determine the actual stretching capacity,2,1
