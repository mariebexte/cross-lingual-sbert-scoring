14,14,fr_020015,The student data provides the test result of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer,2,1

53,53,fr_020054,"Plastic A showed a large difference between T_1 and T2, showing that more experiments are needed to determine a more accurate measurement and error. The other plastics showed more accurate measurements, where plastic B was found to be the plastic that deformed the most in the experiment.  To improve the experiment, the same process would have to be repeated at least 5 times, to achieve greater accuracy. Finally, another way to improve the results would be to conduct the experiments on two or three people so that there is more than one person checking the experimental process.",2,3
63,63,fr_020064,"Construction and demolition waste (CDW), including valuable materials such as plastics, has a remarkable influence on the waste sector. For plastics to be reused, they must be identified and separated based on their polymer composition. In this study, the identification of these materials was performed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which identified the material based on their physicochemical properties. The advantages of the NIR method are low environmental impact and rapid measurement (within seconds) in the _1600-2400 nm spectral range without special sample preparation. Limitations include its inability to analyze dark materials. The identified polymers were used as a component for the wood-polymer composite (WPC), which consists of a polymer matrix, low-cost fillers and additives. The components were first composed of an agglomeration apparatus, followed by extrusion production. In the agglomeration process, the objective was to compound all materials to produce uniformly distributed and granulated materials in pellet form. During the agglomeration process, the polymer (matrix) was melted and the fillers and other additives were then mixed into the molten polymer, being ready for the extrusion process. In the extrusion method, heat and shear forces were applied to a material inside the barrel of a rotating twin-screw type conical extruder, which reduces the risk of burning the materials and reduces the shear mixing. The heated and sheared mixture was then passed through a die to form the product into the desired shape. The protocol described above proved the potential for reuse of CDW materials. The functional properties should be verified according to standard tests, such as flexural, tensile and impact strength tests for the material.  I",2,0
