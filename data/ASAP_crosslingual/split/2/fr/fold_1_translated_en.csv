10,10,fr_020011,"Plastics and rubber are made of polymers consisting of smaller units called monomers, which bond (polymerize) into long chains. At present, the vast majority of monomers are produced from petroleum (crude oil/mineral oil) and are therefore non-renewable. Monomers can also be made from biomass, but usually at a higher cost. Apart from monomers, various additives are added to the manufacturing process of plastics and rubber. Additives are chemicals that are necessary for the polymerization process itself, or give the final product its desired specific properties, e.g. plasticizers, flame retardants, thermal and UV stabilizers, biocides, pigments, thinners, etc. Polymers are large in size, which means that they do not penetrate biological membranes and are not particularly reactive and therefore are not considered toxic. On the contrary, unreacted monomers, solvents, additives or degradation products can leak and be exposed to both humans and the environment throughout the life cycle of a product. Many common additives are classified as hazardous according to the EU Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP)_1 . It is relatively unknown for the majority of these chemicals how they affect our health and the environment, but some phthalates, bisphenol A, certain brominated flame retardants and polyfluorinated chemicals, have been relatively well studied and are therefore the focus of this report. These chemicals have a negative impact on humans and the environment, and surveys have shown that a large proportion of the population is constantly exposed to them. When chemicals are released from products or building materials in a home, the dust functions as a chemical sink that reflects any chemicals that may be exposed to the home. The polluted dust will be inhaled or eaten, as it ends up on food, accumulates in the mucous membranes of the mouth, or when children put dusty fingers and objects in their mouths.",2,0

84,84,fr_020085,"Sample B is the most elastic while sample A is the least elastic, to improve the picture the student could have also entered the initial measurement of the plastic before elongation to have greater accuracy in the comparison",2,2
86,86,fr_020087,Students concluded that plastic B is the most elastic. students could improve their performance by using Hardness: a measure of a material's resistance to deformation under concentrated compressive load and Toughness: a measure of a material's ability to absorb energy during impacts.,2,2

103,103,fr_020104,"There are a number of ways to improve the validity of an experiment, including controlling more variables, improving the measurement technique, increasing randomization to reduce sample bias, blinding the experiment, and adding control or placebo groups.   Controlling more variables is about making sure that as few things as possible change during the experiment.  An ideal experiment is one where one thing is changed and one outcome is examined.  Everything else should stay the same.  So, for example, if you wanted to know how fast balls of different masses would roll down a particular hill, you would change the mass of the ball and keep everything else the same.  You would keep the material of the ball, the point of release, the place of measurement, a method, the humidity of the air, the height above sea level, and anything else you can think of the same.  The more you keep the same, the more likely it is that your result will be valid.   The measurement technique can also be improved.  Maybe instead of measuring something by hand, you could use a computer and an electronic sensor.  Or maybe instead of having one person measure the results, you could have several people take measurements and compare their responses.   Increasing randomization is one way to reduce a particular validity problem: sample bias.  This is when the samples being studied are not a representative sample of the population.  For example, let's say your tests for the effect of a drug and your trials contain mostly white men in their _20s and 30s.  This would not be a good sample because of the lack of range, age and gender. Or maybe you are testing weight loss drugs on people who are already at a healthy weight.  Increasing the randomization of the sample will reduce this problem.",2,2
