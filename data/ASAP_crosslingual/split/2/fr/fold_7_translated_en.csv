156,156,fr_020157,"When you measure the length of the plastic after placing the weights, you can notice how much the plastic has expanded. By analyzing the data, you can see that plastic D kept the same length, meaning that the deformation of this plastic was maximum.",2,1
159,159,fr_020160,(A) Plastic D does not undergo deformation. Plastics A and B undergo deformation. (B) Record the length before the procedure for better comparison. Repeat the procedure one more time to get the results in triplicate.,2,2
160,160,fr_020161,"a: we can see that on the first two types of plastic, the second test shows a higher stretch than the first (_2cm for the first, 1cm for the second). Stranger, the third type of plastic is not stretched but shortened. As for the fourth, it was not altered. The 4 plastics therefore have a very different reaction to stretching. b: He could have let the plastics stretch longer than 5min in order to have more significant data. He also should have measured the materials before the first stretch. b:",2,2

168,168,fr_020169,"A.  Based on the first and second experiments, it can apparently be inferred that the longer the time spent stretching the polymer plastic samples, the more they stretch because the weight on the clamp tends to intensify the stretching.  B. Therefore, if a third experiment were conducted on the same plastic samples, there would likely be an increase in stretching.However, it is recommended that students adopt different types of plastic samples and apply the same weight on them as in this experiment to see if the weight added to the clamp would have the same, similar, or different effects on the plastic samples.And they should also note the time to see how long it may take for a particular sample to stretch than others",2,3
