3,3,fr_020004,Plastic B seems to be the most sensitive to stretching. I probably would have offered more precision on the type of weight used.,2,2
4,4,fr_020005,"A. the results before and after the experiments are very close. this means that the plastic tends to keep its size, but in the case where it got smaller, the temperature could have played a role, or even the measuring system b. make sure the temperature and the measuring system are taken into account",2,2
18,18,fr_020019,we can use a glass plate for an alternative plastic solution.. because the temperature of the plastic can affect the nature of the experiment,2,1
19,19,fr_020020,measure the weight of the hooks to ensure that the same pressure is applied to all materials,2,1
48,48,fr_020049,"a.The plastic will increase in length when we attach both sides and put weight on it.    B.Based on the experiment, we can say that the plastic will increase. From the data collected by the students, we can tell how much the plastic increases in length.",2,1
52,52,fr_020053,The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers which has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer,2,0
55,55,fr_020056,Plastic B is the most flexible of all the samples. The student could have improved the validity of the results by mentioning the types of weights used for each plastic sample and also mentioning the temperature in which the test was done.,2,3
65,65,fr_020066,a)Perform a second trial (T_2) exactly as the first trial (T1). b) Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely over the side of the table.,2,0
70,70,fr_020071,A student conducted the following survey to test four different plastic polymers for stretching.,2,0
75,75,fr_020076,a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b)Glue the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.,2,0
107,107,fr_020108,"He could have measured the temperature of the environment, in addition to recording the weights used.",2,2
116,116,fr_020117,IT'S GOOD AND NICE ON THE NICHE,2,0
132,132,fr_020133,Plastics that stretch longer than the others are probably more malleable.I think the student would put a timer on to evaluate how long it takes for the plastic to stretch,2,2
140,140,fr_020141,"The studensa is very large, they are improved the experimental design.",2,0
149,149,fr_020150,Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples,2,0
152,152,fr_020153,a.How the plastic expands due to the weights hanging on the other side. b.Students can use a simple pulley to increase the tension on the plastic sample.,2,1
154,154,fr_020155,Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table,2,0
155,155,fr_020156,A. The conclusion based on the student's data that I arrive at is that the experiment appears to be effective.  B. I honestly don't see how I could tell what would increase the validity of a scientific experiment.  Maybe using numerical scales?,2,0
186,186,fr_020187,the student was passed,2,0
