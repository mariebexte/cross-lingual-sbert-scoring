11,11,fr_020012,a student conducted the following _1 survey to test,2,0
41,41,fr_020042,The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers that was tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer,2,0
54,54,fr_020055,the second test should be different,2,0
67,67,fr_020068,A. Plastic A is the most stretchable B. Use samples of the same initial length. Use samples of the same initial shape,2,3
80,80,fr_020081,"Take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length and remove the weights and clamp, and measure the length of the plastic types.",2,1
90,90,fr_020091,a)Perform a second test (T_2) exactly as the first test (T1). b)Tape the top edge of the plastic sample to a table so that it hangs loosely over the side of the table.,2,0
95,95,fr_020096,"This type of diagram is based on the type of plastic. This type of tables is very interesting.This is separated by the whole quantity based. This is separated in two ways: T_1 and T2. T1 has 10,22,14,20 numbers in their column. And T2 has 12,23,13,20 numbers in that column. So, all in all, this is a very interesting table.",2,0
96,96,fr_020097,"a)Perform a second trial (T_2) exactly like the first trial (T1) , b)Stick the top edge of the plastic sample on a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table.",2,0
97,97,fr_020098,"Based on the information, we can see that the type D plastic stretches more in millimeters. The student can improve the experiment in two ways: having control and seeing if the ambient temperature affects the stretch.",2,2
108,108,fr_020109,"If they continue to practice as the first step, they can improve",2,0
109,109,fr_020110,"A.there are different types of plastic, which leads to larger volumes of data. B. The student could share the different types of plastic. And the student could also share the weight of each plastic.",2,2
119,119,fr_020120,Have specified the type of plastic and photos or videos of the experiment.,2,1
120,120,fr_020121,The student's design was beautiful.,2,0
126,126,fr_020127,a.Plastic type B had the most stretch. b.The student could have improved the experimental design by attaching a clip to both ends of the samples and separating them to test the stretch. The student could also have them stretch without the weights.,2,2
135,135,fr_020136,Polymer B plastics is shown an amount stretched longer than the others,2,1
141,141,fr_020142,they put it on a clean glass bowl ... keep the measurement of the substance accurately the student must be careful in this experiment,2,0
176,176,fr_020177,The student data provides the result of the test of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average of the result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the stiffness of the structure and the weight of the polymer,2,0
182,182,fr_020183,a. The student's result seems inaccurate because the T_1 and T2 results differ from each other despite the same process. The score on both tests must be the same. b. The student must have given the same attention and applied the same energy on both tests.,2,1
184,184,fr_020185,"The student had received approximately the same results both times in completing the experiment. For this reason, I would have completed the experiment a third time. I would also have made a hypothesis at the beginning of my research.",2,2
