0,55,55,fr_020056,Plastic B is the most flexible of all samples. The student could have improved the validity of the results by mentioning the types of weights used for each plastic sample and also mentioning the temperature at which the test was done.,2,3
1,3,3,fr_020004,Plastic B seems to be the most sensitive to stretching. I would probably have offered more precision on the type of weight used.,2,2
2,132,132,fr_020133,Plastics that stretch longer than others are probably more malevolent.I think the student would put a timer to assess how long it takes for the plastic to stretch.,2,2
3,107,107,fr_020108,"He could have measured the ambient temperature, in addition to informing the weights used.",2,2
4,4,4,fr_020005,"A. The results before and after the experiments are very close. This means that the plastic tends to keep its size, but in case it has become smaller, the temperature may have played a role, or even the measurement system b. make sure that the temperature and the measurement system are taken into account",2,2
5,154,154,fr_020155,Stick the top edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it hangs freely on the side of the table,2,0
6,70,70,fr_020071,One student conducted 'I's next investigation to test four different plastic polymers for 'I's ethically.,2,0
7,75,75,fr_020076,a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b) Stick the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it can freely hang on the side of the table.,2,0
8,52,52,fr_020053,Student data provides the test result of the four plastic polymers that has been tested several times and the average result provides the elasticity of the four different types of polymers. The student would consider two things that play a major role in the elasticity of the polymer is the rigidity of the structure and the weight of the polymer.,2,0
9,186,186,fr_020187,The student passed,2,0
10,140,140,fr_020141,"The studensa is very large, they are improved experimental design.",2,0
11,65,65,fr_020066,a) Perform a second test (T_2) exactly like the first test (T1). b) Stick the upper edge of the plastic sample onto a table so that it can freely hang on the side of the table.,2,0
12,155,155,fr_020156,"by A. The conclusion based on student data I come to is that the experiment seems to be effective.  B. Honestly, I don’t see how I could say what would increase the validity of a scientific experiment.  Maybe by using digital scales?",2,0
13,116,116,fr_020117,It’s good and pleasant in the niche.,2,0
14,149,149,fr_020150,Repeat the procedure exactly for the three remaining plastic samples,2,0
15,152,152,fr_020153,How the plastic dilates due to the hanging weights on the other side. Students can use a simple pulley to increase the tension on the plastic sample.,2,1
16,18,18,fr_020019,we can use a glass plate for an alternative plastic solution.. because the temperature of the plastic can affect the nature of the experiment,2,1
17,19,19,fr_020020,measure the weight of the hooks to ensure that the same pressure is applied to all materials,2,1
18,48,48,fr_020049,"Plastic will increase length when we attach both sides and put weight on them.    Based on experience, we can say that plastic will increase. Thanks to the data collected by the students, we can tell how much the length of the plastic increases.",2,1
