0,168,168,fr_020169,"A. Based on the first and second experiments, it can apparently be inferred that the longer the time spent stretching the polymer plastic samples is, the more they stretch as the weight on the pinch tends to intensify the stretch and length.  by B. Therefore, if a third experiment was conducted on the same plastic samples, there would probably be an increase in stretching.H, it is recommended that students adopt different types of plastic samples and exercise on them the same weight as in this experiment to see if the weight added to the pince would have identical, similar or different effects on the plastic samples.And they should also note the duration to know how long it may take for a particular sample to stretch out than others.",2,3

4,160,160,fr_020161,"a: It is found that on the first two types of plastic, the second test shows a greater stretch than the first (_2cm for the first, 1cm for the second). Strangerly, the third type of plastic is not stretched but shortened. The fourth was not altered. The four plastics therefore have a very different reaction to stretching. b: he could have allowed the plastics to stretch longer than 5min to have more meaningful data. He should also have measured the materials before the first stretching. B is :",2,2
