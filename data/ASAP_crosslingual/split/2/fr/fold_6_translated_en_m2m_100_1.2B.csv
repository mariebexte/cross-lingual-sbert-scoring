Students could have improved the experience if they had done a further trial too they could have been more precise in the procedure for example, they should have told you how much weight you are adding to the plastic",2,3
1,57,57,fr_020058,"The amount of stretching of plastic types varies from _10 to 25 mm. Both type A and C plastics are between 10 and 13 mm in length, while the amount of type D plastic was found to be identical to 20 mm. Plastic type B has the maximum amount of 22-23 mm in the results. The student could have used the different techniques for each method then could have repeated the procedure by changing T1 to T2 and T2 to T1 so that the results are a little more accurate.",2,2
2,26,26,fr_020027,and one. Plastic D appears to be the most stable b. It could use other types of plastics and also collect more data from the experience for more in-depth analysis,2,2
3,29,29,fr_020030,"and a. From the first and second rows of data, it seems that the lengths have increased. But the last two figures seem to be wrong. The lengths of T_2 experiments must be greater than those of T1. One of them is that the student can tie weight on both sides with a pulley. To validate the results, the student can experiment with different initial lengths and show a constant of elasticity.",2,2
4,123,123,fr_020124,The most resistant pattern is D. The elevator would have been more accurate using a measuring device suitable for the elasticity and strength of materials.,2,2

15,36,36,fr_020037,Plastic is hardly stretching. The student could have pulled the plastic himself. The student could have used a machine.,2,1
