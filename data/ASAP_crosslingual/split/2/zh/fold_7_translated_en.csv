18,18,zh_020019,Different types of plastic with different elasticity,2,1
25,25,zh_020026,Increase the weight of the weights,2,0
60,60,zh_020061,a_1 Conclusion: different polymers do not have the same elasticity b2 Improvements Place the same polymer overlapping and hang a heavier weight to make it stretch more significantly,2,1
92,92,zh_020093,(_1) plastic A is the most elastic (2) let the weights hang all the time and measure their elongation length,2,0
103,103,zh_020104,(_1) Different plastics have different elasticity and will shrink or elongate as a result of the force (2) Repeat for each type of plastic several times to observe its generality,2,1
112,112,zh_020113,a The elasticity of different materials is not the same b Control variable method,2,2
115,115,zh_020116,a different material plastic elasticity and two elastic deformation difference is not large b (_1) T2 experiment another take down the same material for the experiment (2) the experimental material cut into the same size and length of the shape and experiment,2,3
135,135,zh_020136,a The elasticity of plastic polymers varies depending on the type and deforms the elasticity Note the controlled variable method Maintain the mass of the weights,2,2
165,165,zh_020166,(_1) whether the length of the plastic is the same (2) whether the mass of the weights is the same,2,2
195,195,zh_020196,(_1) D plastic solidity is good,2,0
208,208,zh_020209,"a:D the strongest elasticity of plastic, A the weakest elasticity b: (_1) when taking four materials, the same length is required (2) four material test to the position of the clamps clamped by each different.",2,1
225,225,zh_020226,"a. D in the plastic ductility is the best b. will be warmed plastic, increase the stretching time, change the plastic structure strength",2,0
235,235,zh_020236,"a.C good elasticity D elasticity stable A,B poor elasticity (_1) twice different mass weights",2,0
237,237,zh_020238,a:Plastic B has the best elasticity b:(_1)replace different weights(2)repeat the test several times,2,2
249,249,zh_020250,"The longer the stretching, the more elastic the polymer is",2,0
251,251,zh_020252,Plastic is ductile,2,0
264,264,zh_020265,Take a certain type of plastic sample and measure its length,2,0
269,269,zh_020270,"The longer the time, the greater the amount of plastic stretching (_1) select a group for control (2) the mass of the clip is ignored",2,0
285,285,zh_020286,a The data from the two experiments did not change much Material properties are stable b Repeat the experiment with different gradients of force Observe the effect,2,0
