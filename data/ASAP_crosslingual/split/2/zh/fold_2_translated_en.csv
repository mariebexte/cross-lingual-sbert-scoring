27,27,zh_020028,a good ductility of plastic B b (_1) before the experiment to try the plastic in the experiment is not conducted when the ductility is correct (2) in the course of the experiment should be taken to control the variables method,2,2
29,29,zh_020030,a C's elasticity is better D's elasticity is relatively stable AB's elasticity is worse (_1) Experiment twice with different masses of weights for the same material,2,0
39,39,zh_020040,Conclusion: D plastic polymer elasticity is more stable Method: Experimental design (_1) multiple experiments to avoid chance (2) strict adherence to control variables,2,3
50,50,zh_020051,a the longer the plastic is stretched the greater the elongation b use a vertical lever to hang so that the force is uniform can increase the amount of weights to reduce the experimental time,2,0
64,64,zh_020065,(_1) Plastic D is less elastic (2) (1) Test again with a weight of greater mass (2) Take longer,2,0
76,76,zh_020077,Conclusion: different plastic polymers have different elasticity Improvements (_1) change the number of plastic polymers to measure to change the results of the experiment (2) apply different tensile forces to the same material and measure multiple times,2,1
87,87,zh_020088,a. The elasticity of different plastic polymers is different and the elasticity of plastic class A is the largest b. (_1) The hanging time of the weights is extended moderately and the hanging time is the same for more than two experiments,2,0
