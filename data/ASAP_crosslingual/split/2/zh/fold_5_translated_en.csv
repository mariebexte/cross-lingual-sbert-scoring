15,15,zh_020016,Class A plastics have the greatest ability to stretch (_1) The force used should not exceed the elastic range of the plastic polymer (2) Be gentle when adding weights,2,0
35,35,zh_020036,Conclusion: The elasticity of plastic is the best in ABCD Method: Colleagues will stretch four types of plastic of equal length and then compare the elongation of the other,2,1
68,68,zh_020069,Polymer elasticity is good to avoid damage to the substance used,2,0
84,84,zh_020085,"(_1) B in the product is more elastic, type A is weaker (2) multiple measurements, less experimental generality (3) to strictly control the variables",2,3
99,99,zh_020100,(_1) the length of plastic D did not change (2) increase the number of weights (3) shorten the hanging time,2,0
126,126,zh_020127,Plastic stretches more than the original length,2,0
131,131,zh_020132,D The elasticity of the plastic product is O ABC three are deformed,2,0
180,180,zh_020181,"Conclusion: the amount of plastic stretching based on the variety of different results are not the same, but the same plastic in multiple stretching its elongation does not change much Improvements: (_1) change the experiment again to control the size of the plastic shape (2) increase the weights back and forth several times",2,2
198,198,zh_020199,"Conclusion: Different materials produce different elasticity results. Methods (_1) controlled variable method, should control the hanging weights and clamps of the same mass (2) the hanging time to test, in case the time is too strong beyond its elastic range",2,2

203,203,zh_020204,"a: four materials polymer elastic stretching is very low b: clear weight mass and plastic between the elasticity can not be too large bundle the same location, pay attention to the dry environment",2,0
204,204,zh_020205,"Conclusion: different materials produce different elasticity results. Methods (_1) control variable method, should control the hanging weights and clips of the same mass (2) the suspension time to test, in case the time is too strong beyond its elastic range",2,1
207,207,zh_020208,"a,Conclusion: the longer the elongation, the greater the elasticityb,Measure the mass of the plastic(_2)Use a spring dynamometer to measure the elasticity",2,0
234,234,zh_020235,(_1) A class A objects compared to other materials are more likely to deformation while D class Cerio more stable not easy to deformation (2) (1) with the same plastic to increase the number of different weights to observe changes (2) increase the time each plastic is suspended,2,0
239,239,zh_020240,"Different materials . The elasticity is very different, control variables",2,2
255,255,zh_020256,(_1) more than three tests (2) change the test to get steps,2,1
259,259,zh_020260,C plastic T_1 is larger than T2.,2,0
266,266,zh_020267,(_1) T(2) is more elastic than T(1) (2) Let the weights hang for 8 minutes (3) Measure the length first and then take the weights,2,0
296,296,zh_020297,a: B plastic is the most elastic A plastic is the least elastic b (_1) Tie the top of the sample with a string to fix it (2) Replace the clip with a hook,2,1
