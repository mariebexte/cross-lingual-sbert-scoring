23,23,de_000325,"a. It depends on the type of plastic whether the stretching is greater on the 1st or 2nd pass, or whether it is the same. b. You could have decreased/increased the time on one of the passes. The fastening (nail instead of glue, for example) could be more stable.",2,2
24,24,de_000326,No idea,2,0
28,28,de_000330,"Plastic A and B are more stretchable in the second pass, C is less stretchable and D is just as stretchable as before. Make more passes.",2,1
45,45,de_000347,He could have repeated the procedure and matched D2 to D1.,2,0
67,67,de_000369,"On the first pass, the samples of plastic stretch a lot. on the 2nd pass, only 0.2mm. i can't think of 2 other possibilities.",2,0
79,79,de_000381,They are different plastics because they stretch differently . You can also measure the length without removing the clamp. You can also measure the length without removing the weight.,2,2
81,81,de_000383,"a) plastic type A is the most stretchable, b) fix sample more firmly to the table, let it hang for a longer time, stronger weight.",2,1
94,94,de_000396,Calculate the different times in this experiment,2,0
114,114,de_000416,the whole material succumbed to changes and extended except d It is possible to heat materials to a certain temperature You can cool materials to a certain temperature This will give an understanding of how things can happen in different climates,2,0
121,121,de_000423,Perform a second pass (D2) that runs exactly like the first pass (D1).,2,0
148,148,de_000450,"a. the plastic parts react differently to the weights. b. All plastic parts would have to be the same length to get a more accurate result. Or you can do the test more times and calculate the average at the end, so you also have a more accurate result.",2,3
165,165,de_000467,You may be interested in the initial value.,2,0
169,169,de_000471,a) The elongation of the plastic does not only depend on the tensile weight b) Make sure that the lengths of the specimens are equal Make sure that the environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) are equal,2,1
194,194,de_000496,"what type of plastic, what weights",2,1
237,237,de_000539,no idea,2,0
250,250,de_000552,He should have taken new samples of the respective type of plastic,2,0
256,256,de_000558,I did not understand that either,2,0
264,264,de_000566,a. It appears that polymer B is the most ductile. b.  The initial length and the cross section of the specimens should be identical,2,2
293,293,de_000595,What is the minimum length of the material at the exit? How much weight is hanging on the film? How much material should protrude over the edge of the table?,2,2
