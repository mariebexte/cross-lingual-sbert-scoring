18,18,de_000320,Hang weights on the clamp and let them hang for five minutes. Remove the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.,2,0
29,29,de_000331,"Plastic B is the most stretchable, then D, then C, then A. A also has the highest variance. The weights could have varied in severity. He could have also varied the time period.",2,3
66,66,de_000368,"a) Plastic types A and B are minimally stretchable, C has become less stretchable and D has remained so. b) The student should have used the exact designation for the plastic type, instead of A,B,C and D. Also, the experimental run should be better labeled, e.g., divide the runs more precisely.",2,0
96,96,de_000398,It can be made with different weights and extension times,2,1
106,106,de_000408,"a) Different plastics show different expansion behavior. b) More precise information on how to bond (spot, flat, etc.) b) Use a caliper gauge to determine the lengths more precisely (with decimal place).",2,2
109,109,de_000411,"a. the plastic is already more stretched from the start, i.e. longer, in the second attempt and is therefore stretched more in the second attempt b. 1. he should use new pieces of plastic in the 2nd attempt 2. I can think of no suggestion for improvement",2,1
120,120,de_000422,There is a normal development in the experiment,2,0
125,125,de_000427,"a.a plastic sample became longer b.you need to specify the mass of the sample, Hang weights on the clamp and let it hang for 15 minutes",2,0
130,130,de_000432,Plastic should be hung on a harness instead of a table. Gravity should be taken into account when calculating the results.,2,0
160,160,de_000462,"Soft plastic expands due to weight, plastic type D is probably very hard.",2,0
172,172,de_000474,material temperature ambient temperature,2,0
175,175,de_000477,he should use new plastic samples. he could have used some kind of lathe for the test.,2,0
206,206,de_000508,Answer C has contracted again. Type of plastic.,2,0
210,210,de_000512,"a) Plastic type B stretches the most, plastic type D the second most, plastic type C the third most and plastic type A the least (at least in absolute terms, for the percentage comparison equal lengths of all plastic types would have to be ensured beforehand). For plastic type A, the deviation between the runs is also highest, for plastic types B and C it is lower and plastic type D seems to be stretched equally in both runs. b) Ensure a constant temperature within the test set-up (possible influence of heat on stretching behavior); equal length of all plastic types at the beginning of the test.",2,2
214,214,de_000516,"Plastic A, B and D stretch the same or more on the 2nd attempt. Only C stretches less.  He should not glue the specimens to the table but attach them with a firm connection that remains constant.",2,1
246,246,de_000548,All plastics were stretched. Sample A was stretched the least. Sample B was stretched the most. Improve validity by using different weights to test how they affect stretching.,2,2
247,247,de_000549,my conclusion that at D1 is reduced and at D2 is not 1- explain a little more clearly 2 - use simpler terms,2,0
262,262,de_000564,"a: Plastics A, B and C may be thermoplastics. In the case of D, I would say that a thermoset was used. b: The length of 5 minutes could be increased to 1 hour to obtain more accurate results.  To be on the safe side again, a D3 would be useful, then you could form an average value, which then says relatively much.",2,1
