2,264,264,de_000566,A. It seems to be the most stretchable polymer B. by b.  The starting length and cross section of the samples must be identical.,2,2
3,79,79,de_000381,They are different plastics because they stretch differently. You can also measure the length without removing the clamp. You can also measure the length without removing the weight.,2,2
4,23,23,de_000325,"A. It depends on the plastic card whether the stretch is at 1 or 2. It is larger, or If she is equally tall. by b. You could have reduced/increased the time of one of the passes. The attachment (nail instead of glue, for example) It could be more stable.",2,2
