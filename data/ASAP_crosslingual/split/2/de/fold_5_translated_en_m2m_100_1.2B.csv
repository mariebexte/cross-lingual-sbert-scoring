4,210,210,de_000512,"a) Plastic type B spreads the most, plastic type D the second most, plastic type C the third most, and plastic type A the least (in any case absolutely, for the percentage comparison, the same lengths of all plastic cards would first have to be ensured). In addition, for plastic type A, the deviation between the passages is the highest, for plastic types B and C it is lower, and plastic type D seems to be stretched equally in both passages.  (b) Ensure a consistent temperature within the experimental structure (possible influence of heat on stretching behavior); equal length of all plastic cards at the beginning of the experiment",2,2

Also, the course of the experiment should be better marked, e.g. Divide the passes more accurately.",2,0

To be sure again, a D3 would be useful, then you could form a mean value, which then says relatively much.",2,1
