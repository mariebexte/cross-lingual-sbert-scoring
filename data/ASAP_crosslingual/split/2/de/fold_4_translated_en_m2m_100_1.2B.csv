0,178,178,de_000480,"Conclusion: Different stretching depending on the material used, B and D as well as A and C are quite similar.    Weight should be defined to ensure that it is equally heavy The plastics should be equal in length",2,3
1,100,100,de_000402,"In three trials, the stretching was different in the first and second passes. Improvement: - Plastic sample not attached to the edge of the table, but attached to a clamp - set the result in a smaller measurement unit",2,2
2,238,238,de_000540,How heavy are the weights? How thick is the plastic? Are all tests equal?,2,2
3,13,13,de_000315,Conclusion: Plastic can deform plastically. Improvement: not sticking (possible chemical exposure) but straining,2,2
4,201,201,de_000503,"There is no indication of the length of the plastic part. Plastic parts of the same length would be more suitable for comparison. Alternatively, a percentage indication of the stretch as a result is more meaningful. Instead of the names ABC, it would be relevant for a result consideration which plastics are concerned.",2,2
5,126,126,de_000428,"Its function is to increase the performance of bitumen This increases, for example, the tolerance to temperature and cold The performance of bitumen is expressed as """"Performace Grade"""" and is often the pre-addition of polymer PG64-10 Dh it is able to keep the temperature up to 64 and the lowest -10 When polymer is added, it is PG70-16 That is, its efficiency increased to 70 degrees Celsius The question arises: What if the bitumen PG64-10 and the asphalt temperature 70 or above -10?  If the temperature exceeds 64, the asphalt layer will be soft and if loads are exceeded, it will not be known, on the contrary, if the temperature reaches more than -10, the bitumen will solidify and cracks will begin on the surface of the asphalt concrete.",2,0

9,218,218,de_000520,Probe A is the most stretchable of the four polymer resins. Test C is drawn.  Different material depths can be assessed Different environmental conditions of heat and humidity can be assessed.,2,0
10,140,140,de_000442,"The plastic cards A+B have become longer. Card D remains the same. And card C has become shorter, which seems unlikely. The test should be repeated with heavier weights. The weights must also remain longer than five minutes.",2,0

12,137,137,de_000439,"and a. The first two stretched samples have increased b.next two samples has remained almost the same The experiment should be carried out within four walls so that it is no longer distinguished from gas D.use different types of plastic, so it can have different results",2,0

15,72,72,de_000374,a) Depending on the material it will stretch more b) take weight measurements before C) hang from the ceiling,2,1
16,74,74,de_000376,The student became more familiar and consistent during the attempt. Directly perform multiple experiments on a plastic sample. Perform more than two experiments per plastic sample.,2,1
17,296,296,de_000598,"Plastic type A spreads the most (not only the biggest difference, even percentage. In the case of D, nothing changes. Change the test time (1). 5 minutes and 2. 10 minutes to 3. 15 min); the same length of the sample (also the same length freely hanging) ",2,1
18,185,185,de_000487,a) all polymer plastics are stretched except probe C b) 1.he should have used several polymer plastics of the same type and which place next to each other and then compare the results with each other 2.he should also have used double weights and then look ub which are also double stretched,2,1
