4,277,277,de_000579,"The material affects the stretchability of the polymer plastic. Depending on what kind of material it is, the plastic expands stronger. Hang the weight in the middle of the plastic pipe and not at a corner.  Bring all plastic tubes to the initial length, as it is not stated whether they are all the same length.",2,2

The first plastic is the most unstable, B has stretched, but C has stretched and plastic that D has not stretched has merged to a lesser extent, he has remained the same.  by b.

8,177,177,de_000479,"While the plastic cards A and B have increased in length, C has even gone back and D remains the same. The test could be done. Repeat in which you pull the plastic threads at both ends and measure how much force needs to be spent until they break. This is repeated several times to find the boundary.",2,0

17,197,197,de_000499,a) One can find that the same material is stretched differently b) It is difficult to say how it could have improved the results... the measurement concept is not 100% logical and one could have represented it differently,2,1
18,62,62,de_000364,"The data recorded through the analyses state that in all experiments there is a homogeneity in terms of the length of the layer, so the material is relatively the same.  A possible improvement would be a change in the types of plastic used. Put different weights and calculate the points of plasticity and rupture.",2,1
