20,20,de_000322,a. The data suggests plastics B and D are more extensible than C and A. b. The student should have looked for an identical cross-section of the stretched plastic and set the stretched distance in relation to the initial length.,2,2
31,31,de_000333,The plastic becomes longer due to the weight - Carry out more specimens - Use plastic of different thicknesses,2,3
44,44,de_000346,"a.) While some plastics (A, B) increase in length, others (D) remain stable, or (C) even shorten. b.) Instead of a chemical adhesive for the purpose of fixing the plastic at the upper end, which could have a manipulating effect on the nature of the plastic, a mechanical one should be chosen, e.g. by stapling.",2,1
59,59,de_000361,a.  Plastic type A will be more stretchable B C D will remain constant. b. Attach plastic specimen to bottom of table so that the force effect is straight to the floor.        Further passes.,2,1
91,91,de_000393,The plastic could let hang by a hook. The plastics could stay in water for e.g. 5 min. first.,2,0

113,113,de_000415,"D. has neither stretched nor elongated. With a heavy clamp, and with different material, the experiment would have turned out differently.",2,0

127,127,de_000429,"A good methods section describes what you did in the lab in a way that is easy to understand and detailed enough to be repeated. Follow the guidelines below to improve your methods:  If your methods are not easy to follow, you can ask someone to read it. Ask him or her to identify places in the procedure that are not clear, and then revise those places for more clarity. It may be more helpful to include words that help the reader follow the process of the experiment: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3; first, then, finally; first second third; after, next, later, following; etc. If your method is difficult to follow because it is long and complicated, consider breaking it down into separate parts, each with a subheading. You can divide it into the typical parts of an experimental procedure (such as lab setup, lab procedures, and data analysis) or, if there were multiple experiments, a part for each experimental procedure. If you need to add more detail to your methods, go back to the Lab Manual and the notes you or a lab partner took during the procedure and use them to remind yourself of what you did in the lab",2,0
154,154,de_000456,You could tabulate the weights hanging for each plastic and see their proportion according to the material used as plastic,2,0
170,170,de_000472,"The denser the smaller material, the more stretchable",2,0
188,188,de_000490,"To improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experiences (at least three) and evaluate the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity. According to the data obtained in the experiment, sample A has greater extensibility and sample C has retractable properties.",2,1

203,203,de_000505,"The more runs, the more accurate the mean - more measurements More accurate conditions (which weights? Always at the exact same place? Timing with stopwatch?)",2,2
225,225,de_000527,The results differ in three out of four cases. The question is whether this is due to measurement inaccuracy or sample deviations.  More accurate measurement Ensure uniformity of samples,2,2
226,226,de_000528,It has almost come to the same result. Could have taken different quantities to achieve a different result.,2,0
