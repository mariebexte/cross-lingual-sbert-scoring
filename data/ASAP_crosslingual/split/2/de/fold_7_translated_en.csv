22,22,de_000324,"- why does the plastic type D not change?  Presumably it is hard plastic, the sotff is firmer and more resistant, than A-C - better result: use raw materials comparable in condition and consistency",2,0
58,58,de_000360,- Measurement in vacuum - measurement under uniform temperature,2,0
62,62,de_000364,"The data recorded by the analyses say that in all the experiments there is homogeneity in terms of the length of the layer, therefore the material is relatively the same.  A possible improvement would be to change the types of plastic used. Put different weights and calculate the points of plasticity and fracture.",2,1
87,87,de_000389,"the time they use the weights, and try different weights.",2,2
95,95,de_000397,Try different weights and allow more time to try the new method.,2,1
124,124,de_000426,"a. The first plastic is the most unstable, B he/she has extended, but C has contracted and plastic that D has not extended, in smaller measure, he/she has remained the same. b. The experimental configuration that could have measured the volume of the plastics, and also its capacity of absorption.",2,0
131,131,de_000433,A) The degree of ductility in the second pass was even greater than the first. B) 1)Weigh the goods on electronic scales; 2)Fix loads in the same place.,2,0
145,145,de_000447,a) Sample D has the same results b) The length with which the Pr Pr is started must be taken into account.,2,0
167,167,de_000469,"Plastics A, B and C stretched differently. He could have taken weights of different weights and performed several tests.",2,2
177,177,de_000479,"While plastic types A and B have increased in length, C has actually decreased and D has remained the same. The test could be repeated by pulling the plastic threads at both ends and measuring how much force is needed to break them. Repeat this several times to find the limit.",2,0
197,197,de_000499,a) You can see that the same material is stretched differently b) Hard to say how he could have improved the results...maybe the measurement concept is not 100% logical and you could have presented it differently,2,1

202,202,de_000504,"Plastic type B is the most ductile, followed by D, C and A. Possibilities for improvement: 1. the experiment could have been carried out with different """"hanging times"""". 2. the experiment could have been carried out with different weights.",2,3

232,232,de_000534,"a) Although it was the same procedure, the two results differ. b) 1. measure the time accurately (was a stopwatch used?) 2. avoid parallax?",2,1
241,241,de_000543,The experiment shows that the samples behave in an unpredictable way.One could have made several more experimental runs and done it with different weights.,2,2
255,255,de_000557,he should fasten materials better,2,0
277,277,de_000579,"a.  The material affects the stretchability of the polymer plastic. Depending on what kind of material it is, the plastic will stretch more. b. Hang the weight centrally on the plastic pipe and not on a corner.  Saw all plastic pipes to the initial length, as it does not say here whether they are all the same length.",2,2
