13,13,de_000315,Conclusion: plastic can deform plastically. Improvement: do not glue ( possible chemical action) but clamp.,2,2
72,72,de_000374,"a) depending on the material, it will stretch more b) take weight measurements C) hang from the ceiling",2,1
74,74,de_000376,The student became more familiar and consistent during the experiment. Directly perform multiple trials on one plastic sample. Conduct more than two trials on each plastic sample.,2,1
100,100,de_000402,"In three specimens, the elongation was different in the first and second pass. Improvement: - Do not glue the plastic specimen to the edge of the table, but fix it to a clamp - Determine the result in a smaller measuring unit.",2,2
126,126,de_000428,"Its function is to increase the performance of the bitumen This increases, for example, the tolerance to temperature and cold The performance of the bitumen is expressed as """"Performace Grade"""" and is often the pre-addition of polymer PG64-10 Ie it is able to maintain the temperature up to 64 and the lowest -10 When polymer is added, it becomes PG70-16 That is, its efficiency increased to 70 degrees Celsius The question arises: what if the bitumen PG64-10 and the asphalt temperature 70 or above -10?  If the temperature exceeds 64, the asphalt layer will be soft and if loads are exceeded, it will not be known In contrast, if the temperature reaches more than -10, the bitumen will solidify and cracks will begin on the surface of the asphalt concrete",2,0
137,137,de_000439,"a. The first two stretched samples have increased b.next two sample has remained almost the same The experiment should be conducted within four walls, so that it is no longer different from gas D.use different kinds of plastic, so it may have different results",2,0
140,140,de_000442,"Plastic types A + B have become longer. Platic type D has remained the same. And card C has become shorter, that seems unlikely. The test should be performed again with heavier weights. The weights must also stay longer than five minutes.",2,0
147,147,de_000449,"Do not glue the plastic, but attach it immediately to a rack with a hook. Do not remove the weight before measuring.",2,0
152,152,de_000454,"a) Plastic A is the most ductile, plastic C will eventually tear b) Fixed stationary structure of all test materials with attached length scale",2,0
156,156,de_000458,- is the plastic reused in the second pass (D2)?,2,0
176,176,de_000478,The plastic was stretched. Test setup can be improved with the weight.,2,0
178,178,de_000480,"Conclusion: different elongation depending on the material used, B and D and A and C are quite similar.    Weight should be defined to ensure that it is the same The plastics should have the same length",2,3
185,185,de_000487,a) all polymer plastics are stretched except sample C b) 1.he should have used several polyplastics of the same type and put them next to each other and then compare the results with each other 2.he should have also used double weights and then see if they are also doubly stretched,2,1
196,196,de_000498,by how much did the glue give way how big did the hole become how heavy were the weights,2,0
201,201,de_000503,"No indication of the length of the plastic part. Plastic parts of the same length would be more suitable for comparison. Alternatively, a percentage specification of the elongation as a result would make more sense. Instead of the NAmen ABC, it would be relevant for a result consideration which plastics are involved.",2,2
218,218,de_000520,Sample A is the most extensible of the four polymer resins. Specimen C is retractable.  Different material thicknesses can be evaluated Different environmental conditions of heat and humidity can be evaluated.,2,0
238,238,de_000540,How heavy are the weights? How thick is the plastic? Are all specimens the same thickness?,2,2
296,296,de_000598,"a. Plastic type A stretches the most (not only the biggest difference, also in percentage. D is the only type that does not change. b. Changing the test time (1. 5 min, 2. 10min, 3. 15 min); Same length of sample (also same length free hanging).",2,1
