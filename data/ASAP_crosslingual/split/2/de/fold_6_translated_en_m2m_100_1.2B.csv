0,31,31,de_000333,The plastic will be longer by weight - carry out more samples - use different thick plastic,2,3
1,225,225,de_000527,The results differ in three out of four cases. The question is whether it is due to measurement accuracy or deviations in the samples.  More accurate measurement to ensure uniformity of the samples,2,2
2,20,20,de_000322,and a. The data suggests that the plastics B and D are more stretchy than C and A. b. The student should have paid attention to an identical cross section of the stretched plastic and set the stretched stretch in proportion to the starting length.,2,2

9,127,127,de_000429,"A good method section describes what you did in the lab so that it is easy to understand and detailed enough to be repeated. Follow the following guidelines to improve your methods: If your methods are not easy to follow, you can ask someone to read it. Ask him or her to identify places in the procedure that are not clear, and then review those places for more clarity. It may be more helpful to include words that help the reader follow the process of the experiment: step 1, step 2, step 3; first, then, finally; first, second, third; after, next, later, next; etc. If your method is difficult to follow because it is long and complicated, then consider splitting it into separate sections with each a subtitle. You can divide it into the typical parts of an experimental procedure (such as laboratory construction, laboratory procedures, and data analysis) or, if there were multiple experiments, one part for each experimental procedure. If you need to add more details to your methods, go back to the lab manual and to the notes you or a laboratory partner made during the procedure, and use them to remember what you did in the laboratory.",2,0

16,188,188,de_000490,"In order to improve the validity of the results, it is necessary to repeat the experiences (at least three) and to assess the influence of external factors such as temperature and humidity. According to the data obtained in the experiment, the sample A has greater stretchability and the sample C has pullable properties.",2,1
17,44,44,de_000346,"A) The  While some plastics (A, B) increase in length, others (D) remain stable, or (C) even shorten. b) the  Instead of a chemical glue for the purpose of fixing the plastic at the top end, which could manipulate the structure of the plastic, a mechanical should be chosen, e.g. B for clutches.",2,1
