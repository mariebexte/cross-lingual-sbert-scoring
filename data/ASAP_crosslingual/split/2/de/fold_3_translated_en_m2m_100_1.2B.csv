0,286,286,de_000588,"a) The only possible conclusion is that the materials actually stretch. A comparison between the samples is not possible because only changes in length (in mm) were recorded, but not stretches (unified).  b) Calculation of the starting lengths and accordingly calculation of the stretches // Calculation of the mass of the weights/clamps and accordingly calculation of the force exercised // additional values necessary depending on the purpose of the experiment",2,3

I think it could be improved by collecting a third sample to compare it with the other 2 results and check the quality of both.  2nd Apply more minutes when the samples hang, instead of 5 minutes, try both samples for 10 minutes.",2,2

6,76,76,de_000378,Take a sample of a plastic and miss its length. Stick the top corner of the plastic sample to a table so that it can freely hang on the side of the table. Fix a clamp at the lower corner of the plastic sample. Hang weights on the clamp and let them hang for five minutes. Remove the weights and clamps and miss the length of the plastic. Repeat the procedure for the other three plastic samples. Perform a second passage (D2) that expires exactly like the first passage (D1).,2,0
