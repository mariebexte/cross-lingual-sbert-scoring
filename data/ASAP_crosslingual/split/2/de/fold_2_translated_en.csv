40,40,de_000342,"The fact that D1 and D2 always deviate (except for plastic type D) shows or can be concluded that it is not possible to write down a fixed value, since there is always some deviation. The experiment could be improved by carrying out several tests D1 - D10 (e.g.) and taking the mean value so that the deviation is as small as possible.",2,1

157,157,de_000459,"My conclusion is that plastic types A and B become more ductile if they have already been stretched once, while plastic type C becomes less ductile and plastic type D remains the same. To improve the experimental setup, one should have checked more carefully whether the plastic has not been stretched before. And perhaps also compare pre-stretched with unstretched of the same type side by side?",2,0
158,158,de_000460,"It can be seen in the individual values that there were small deviations between the two runs, except for the fourth plastic. Here, an average value could be calculated to obtain a reasonably useful result. However, plastic A stretched the least, plastic D the most. Plastic A would therefore have the highest strength, plastic D the lowest. For a more accurate result, more runs would have had to be made or a tensile test would have had to be performed to determine the ductility.",2,2

The student could have repeated the experiment at different temperatures.",2,3
