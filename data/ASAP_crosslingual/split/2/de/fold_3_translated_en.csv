42,42,de_000344,"The polymer has grown by a total of 22 and 23 mm, so 45mm in total. You could have taken different weights, which would have given you different results.",2,1
64,64,de_000366,weight of material temperature,2,0
76,76,de_000378,Take a sample of a plastic and measure its length. Tape the top corner of the plastic sample to a table so that it can hang freely down the side of the table. Attach a clamp to the bottom corner of the plastic sample. Hang weights from the clamp and let it hang for five minutes. Remove the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic. Repeat the procedure for the remaining three plastic samples. Perform a second run (D2) exactly like the first run (D1).,2,0
85,85,de_000387,A. Polymer plastics have different extensibilities when subjected to mechanical force. b. The student should have provided information on the weights used in KG and represented the respective figure in the graph.,2,2
89,89,de_000391,I would try with the time they use the weights and try different weights.,2,2
115,115,de_000417,a. The LA polymer has greater physical-mechanical properties b.It would improve the results to distinguish between natural polymers and systemic polymers,2,0
134,134,de_000436,I do not know how the results change,2,0
150,150,de_000452,"I think they took different weights, so the data was distorted. One could have taken uniform, which is not explained in the example. Otherwise, unfortunately, I can not think of any more possibilities.",2,1
151,151,de_000453,"After removing the weights, leave the samples for about 5 minutes to 10 minutes and then measure the results. Leave the weights on the sample for 10 to 15 minutes.",2,1
153,153,de_000455,You should tabulate each weight and compare them to each material so you know which is more resistant,2,0
166,166,de_000468,"better polymer plastic samples, Repeat the procedure for the remaining three plastic samples.",2,0
183,183,de_000485,you measure how the plastic deforms under the pull of gravity. you measure the length at the beginning and at the end.,2,0
205,205,de_000507,"Conclusion: A and B wear out, while C and D remain the same or even harden. Improvements: Digital monitoring of the process; parallel comparison setups for better analogy.",2,0
207,207,de_000509,Sample A shows greater extensibility and sample C shows retractable properties.  More replicates are needed to improve the validity of the results,2,1
234,234,de_000536,"A) in relation to D1, D2 had a greater exact strain in sample C where the result had a lower strain than the other samples.  B) 1. I think it could be improved by collecting a third sample to compare it with the other 2 results and check the quality of both.  2. apply more minutes when the samples hang, instead of 5 minutes, try 10 minutes both samples.",2,2

267,267,de_000569,The extensibility of B is the largest and then D. A is the smallest 1) Use longer specimens 2) More than two carry out.,2,2
286,286,de_000588,"a) The only possible conclusion is that the materials actually stretch. A comparison between the specimens is not possible, since only length changes (in mm), but not strains (unitless) were recorded. b) Recording of the initial lengths and corresponding calculation of the strains // Recording of the mass of the weights/clamps and corresponding calculation of the force exerted // Further values necessary depending on the objective of the experiment.",2,3
