0,283,283,de_000585,"a) If I assume that all plastic samples at the beginning had the same shape (equal length, width, and thickness), then the plastics B and D are more stretchy than A and C. b) The student could have indicated the original length, width, and thickness of the samples and the mass of the weights. The student could have repeated the experiment at different temperatures.",2,3
1,158,158,de_000460,"It can be seen from the individual values that there were small deviations between the two passes, except for the fourth plastic. Here it could be formed as an average to obtain a half-useable result. Plastic A has spread the least, plastic D the most. Plastic A has the highest strength and plastic D has the lowest. For a more accurate result, one would have had to do more passes or just a pull attempt to determine the stretchability.",2,2

In order to improve the experimental structure, it would have been necessary to check more closely whether the plastic has not been stretched before.
