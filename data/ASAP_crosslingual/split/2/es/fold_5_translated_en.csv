32,32,es_33SA9F9TRZ7DW0HL8U8RIKJURV9WEW,I could make another preba to have 3 prebas of the experiment.,2,1
69,69,es_386PBUZZXHA5WMREIHCG6PF60NALJ6,a. Samples A and B are longer at the endSample C is shorterSample D is unchangedb. The experiment can have more information about the times of the experiment.,2,0
87,87,es_39N5ACM9HG06HVT3OXEAYCAN25K9P1,Plastic B is the most elastic plastic. Do more than 2 tests for best results and use different clamps.,2,2
93,93,es_39ZSFO5CAA98FCE8RV4HXCBPA0RUJ2,Plastics A and B increased in length in the second test. Plastic C did not increase in length. Plastic D did not change in the second test. It would have been better to use different types of plastics and methods.,2,0
94,94,es_3A0EX8ZRNA1JE201D4OP29YPULRBYU,A. Plastium is very elastic. That's why so many millimeters could be gained in the experiment 5 minutes at a time. The plastic could have been bent with itself. This might have helped the plastic not to be so elastic.,2,0
115,115,es_3CP1TO84PVERO1QLJ9QHQJXSB8B256,"The polymer samples were probably not under the same weight during the tests, another factor could have been the ambient temperature, which is why the results were so diverse.",2,0
122,122,es_3DY4FPOOA31PQFML4QNVVPZZRR4VRT,"The elasticity of polymers A, B and C show some difference between the two tests, and polymer D showed a constant elasticity. The polymer with the highest elasticity is B. The experiment could be improved in the table by noting the initial measurements of each polymer.",2,2
167,167,es_3LO69W1SU5QV5K1DABRD9CNQZFNGLM,"In conclusion, I could say that it is, let's say, good, there is no room for improvement.",2,0
175,175,es_3N1FSUEFL7DWVSK12TROHAIIZG5D42,"Plastic polymer A is the most elastic because it underwent less deformation after it was subjected to elongation. To improve the design of the experiment, the initial length of the plastic samples and also the length when they were with the weights should have been noted. Additionally, indicate whether the second test was performed with the same samples or with different samples.",2,2
176,176,es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGC349DUW,"Polymer D recovers its size after the test, in case it was altered at the time of the test, if the size was not altered that polymer is the one with the best resistance to deformation, polymers A and B do not recover their size in case it is different from the beginning, they have less resistance to deformation. For me it is necessary to know how much the polymers measure at the beginning and during the experiment to draw better conclusions if it is not me who does it and only read this information",2,1
197,197,es_3PIWWX1FJLJZ1W3EFW03QA2EMKBJJ6,You could improve it with a scale chart or graphs with the types of plastic and the corresponding data a b c d .,2,0
198,198,es_3PIWWX1FJLJZ1W3EFW03QA2EWL3JJA,"a. Plastic sample A has higher elasticity than the remaining plastic samples, i.e., B, C and D.n Plastic samples B and C have equal elasticity, being lower than sample A and higher than sample D.n Plastic sample D is shown to have lower elasticity than the samples presented, i.e., A, B and C.nnb. You can use a press to measure the higher elasticity of the samples.n You can place the samples at the same time and measure the time it takes for them to stretch, and thus measure the stretching time.",2,1

THE B STUDENT'S HIGHEST CREDIT POINT STORY IS B AND THE B STUDENT'S HIGHEST CREDIT POINT STORY AND EACH STUDENT HAS AN AVERAGE SCORE OF C AND D. THE STUDY CONTAINS A PLASTIC USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RESULT.",2,0
233,233,es_3SEPORI8WPCE0I5E3CQCL5NLNXUAZE,"Plastic B was the one that gained the least length and D stayed the same, C stayed smaller and A was the one that gained the most length. The student could have cancelled out the polymers that got smaller or stayed the same.",2,0
236,236,es_3SUWZRL0M0QF2L2FHCVNKQKHV6T6E0,"Sometimes it is good to have a costant like always adding the same weight to all the plastics to see how much electisity it has, but since not one plastic was the same as the other you could have tried to hang it from different areas or use a little more or less weight.",2,1

255,255,es_3VP0C6EFSI9DE9USYAJ6XYPQ8876MG,a) plastic B has the most elasticity and plastic A has the least elasticity. b) Specify that the initial dimensions of each polymer are the same. Give more detail on how to glue the edge of the sample to the table and also how to attach the weight to the other edge.,2,3
258,258,es_3W92K5RLWWU0LSON7JASSOU323U5VV,"a) The only conclusion that can be made is that polymer D has resistance to the weights during the five minutes. b) To have better results, the initial measurement would have been determined by two polymers and a third test (P3).",2,2
276,276,es_3YDGXNSEO17KEXOALLG8VI4HTUW48Q,The most flexible plastic was type A because it gained more length at the end of the experiment. It would have been better to use some kind of apparatus that could apply torque to the different types of plastic so the researchers knew exactly how much force was applied to the plastic.,2,0
