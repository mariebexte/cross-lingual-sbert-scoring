77,77,es_38SKSKU7R3A91B780ZRGUO06EX6LIK,the p2 plastic is a little bit not so strong so it is recommended to test it with a trandlucid plastic and see how it behaves on it so if the whole experiment could be successful or it could go well.,2,0

89,89,es_39PAAFCODOD26UZD8FSQV40HF96VT5,"At first glance it seems that plastic B is the most elastic, because it is the one that has gained the most length in both experiments. However, what should be measured is the relative increase in length, i.e. the ratio between what was stretched and the original length. Because at no time is it said that all the polymers used had the same initial length. Nor does it say what happens after the weights are removed, i.e. whether the sample returns to its original length or whether it is stretched. We do not know if the second experiment was done after the polymers returned to their initial shape or not. If the weights are excessive, the polymers may be permanently deformed, and we would no longer be measuring elasticity, which has to do with the ability of the material to return to its original shape after stretching. I would then progressively increase the weights, always checking that the polymers can return to their original shape after removal, to make sure that they have not been deformed by excessive loading. The experiment would be limited by the maximum weight that the least elastic polymer could support, comparing the lengths of all the polymers with this weight. Or the most elastic one could be found after eliminating the other three by permanent deformation with increasing weights.",2,3

The test should be completed with different weights and different exposure times. The temperature of the ambient test and of the specimen should be noted.,2,2
107,107,es_3BDCF01OGZ7VRBMD4HDJGCUU768LYD,"The conclusion of this experiment, according to the results shown above, is that plastic type A is the least elastic, since between P1 and P2 it has increased its size by 2 mm. Plastic type B is better than type A, because it has only increased by 1mm, but the best of the four is type C, since it recovers the size of P1 and even reduces by 1mm, followed by type D, which remains the same between P1 and P2. The problem with this experiment is that it does not tell us the initial size of the different types of plastic, so we do not know exactly the results of P1.",2,1
140,140,es_3G5F9DBFORAC1L8I8LB1HLXTBYYVHR,"The conclusion is that the plastic is moldable, and resistant to breakage, you can design the best possible expirement by screening the main and final size instead of just the increments.",2,2
160,160,es_3K4J6M3CXG6E91A9DK2N0Y7F4DYGAX,"a. It is concluded that the structure of plastic C develops a tensile strength because in the second measurement it contracts instead of stretching further. Plastic D is stable in tension because in the two measurements the length gain is equal. Plastics A and B are less resistant to tension because in each test they lengthened a little. The student could also have taken the length of the plastic samples without removing the weights and compared that length to the original length. The subtraction of these lengths constitutes the true elasticity of the plastic. The second way to improve the experiment is to make more than two measurements (tests P3, P4, etc.). This allows a graphical representation of the elongation compared against the stress by the applied weight and would allow to establish the permanent deformation of each plastic in relation to the weight.",2,1

163,163,es_3KXIR214I6T9SIML5477LRREBAI24Z,There are some plastics that have different elasticities. Plastic A and B gained length but plastic C and D lost length. The student could heat the plastic or freeze the plastic to get better results and to improve the design of the experiment.,2,0

One way to make the results more valid would be to make at least one more measurement and then create an average with all the results obtained.",2,2

The data, once selected and collected, must be coded, a process that consists of transferring the information to specially designed forms, which are then copied or punched into electronic processing cards to be stored in the computer.1 The storage is done in fixed-size files, by means of a program that structures a single set in the form of a two-dimensional matrix that is then copied or punched into electronic processing cards to be stored in the computer.1",2,0
