22,22,es_32ZKVD547H0IYZ3DOJVZCF2CJINB39,The plastic sample seems to have expanded more with the second experiment. The student could have made a better table of the results in order to understand it better.,2,0
28,28,es_33JKGHPFYE7LLU0KXR5NZ9BC5X4NMF,It can be concluded that the student obtained similar data in the two tests. The student can improve the design of the experiment by doing one more test.,2,1
30,30,es_33LK57MYLVII0ER8KCC365HR3PLZSL,a. Plastic D takes longer and is the worst. Must have more plastic samples to see better results.,2,0
53,53,es_36AHBNMV1TPCTZYLR0FVXZMP5Z1DYV,"Most plastics are the same, so the experiment did not give much relevant data to make a complete study.",2,0
76,76,es_38JBBYETQQN1NYY1YO28NS03ZSI4EY,"in the table of values the student should have placed the values of the, and have taken into account the types of plastic to know their density, the experiment shows that plastic D did not suffer a change in length due to weight, plastic C reduced its length, and plastics A and B slightly increased their length.",2,0
81,81,es_39GXDJN2OVRJ8A7P5HHV484U175V8M,"Plastics used in this test have different reactions to heat. The one that resists deformation best is plastic A. B is the worst. This tank needs defined temperatures. Also, the original length of the plastics.",2,2
90,90,es_39RP059MEJ6JKLBNU10E8EBIKU1BMT,"a. Most of the plastic types (A, B and C) suffer an appreciable deformation after 5 minutes of being subjected to a stretching work. Perform the same test, but now taking into account the weight to which the samples are subjected: e.g. test with 0.5kg, 1kg and 1.5kg. \nPerform the same test, now subjecting the plastic samples to longer stretching times and record the results for 10, 15 and 20 minutes.",2,2

156,156,es_3JV9LGBJWVR3B54AN3751TRKU81GOO,"a) All the plastic materials used by the student elongate variably under the same circumstances. Except for material D which elongates constantly. b) You could have performed a larger number of tests for each material first, so that the results would have been more conclusive. Describe at what exact measurement height you placed the clamp.",2,2

196,196,es_3PH3VY7DJNAB7V8H4HM43UKCIM5ZW1,"a. The plastic C lost length instead of gaining length, it is not logical for this to happen.nb. 1. Use two support points and a horizontal rigid rail.n 2.",2,1
200,200,es_3PPTZCWALSX6NYCVS8NYB52QJDKQZT,"a) The plastics mostly tend to expand with applied weight, but the length gained with weight is not uniform over time, except for polymer D, which in both tests expanded at the same rate.",2,2
211,211,es_3QEMNNSB2ZCTEF2K4RPVKM2SQ6JD7M,"The most flexible sample is B and the least flexible sample is A. \On the other hand, sample D is the most uniform since both samples give the same value. The other samples have variable values within an admissible limit.",2,1
216,216,es_3QXNC7EIPK83TEPJ7CZKJB9F2SW097,a. The conclusion is that polymer B is the most elastic of the four tested. nb. Two ways to improve the experiment are 1. to include the original measurement of each sample and 2. to include the amount of weight hung on each sample.,2,3

The assignment is to read the description of a simple science experiment and answer a question about the experiment.Please read the assignment description carefully. You should also pay attention to the tables or pictures included in the exercises. Answer the question in English, using one or two sentences. Please answer the questions using your knowledge to the best of your ability. Answers that do not make sense or are copies of others will be rejected.",2,0
292,292,es_3ZGVPD4G6VUJFE4N9CHTGADDBBETZV,a. Sample D is the most elastic. The ayb specimens report permanent deformations. Sample C is shortened.nb. Use specimens of the same shape.,2,1
