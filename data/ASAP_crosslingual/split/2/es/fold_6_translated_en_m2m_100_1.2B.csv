The student can improve the validity of the measurements by making more attempts and averaging the values obtained for each sample. You could also vary the weights used to see the relationship between the weight and length of the sample.",2,3

It would be interesting to know the value of the weight subject to the hugs to establish the weight-length ratio. They could have measured the resistance of the material, applying the Force between area formula.",2,2

Therefore, we really don’t know if by letting more time pass, each plastic would have returned to its natural state. On the other hand, we do not know exactly the measures with which I start each plastic. It would have been more useful to add the initial measurements, the measurements after 5 minutes, the measurement after 1 hour, and finally the difference (or what has gained in mm) after 5 minutes and then the hour.",2,2

Ultimately, the plastic should retain its original length by applying a weight on one of its ends, but never shrink. In order to improve the design of the experiment, the student should have included a scheme of the experiment. In addition, he should have detailed the dimensions of the plastic to be used in the experiment.",2,1
