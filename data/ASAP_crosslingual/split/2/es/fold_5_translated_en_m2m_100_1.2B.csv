0,255,255,es_3VP0C6EFSI9DE9USYAJ6XYPQ8876MG,a) plastic B is the one that has the highest elasticity and plastic A is the one that has the lowest elasticity.\nb) Specify that the initial dimensions of each polymer are equal. Give more detail of how to stick the sample edge to the table and also how to stick the weight on the other edge.,2,3
1,87,87,es_39N5ACM9HG06HVT3OXEAYCAN25K9P1,Plastic B is the most elastic plastic.\nMake more than 2 tests for better results and use different hugs.,2,2
2,122,122,es_3DY4FPOOA31PQFML4QNVVPZZRR4VRT,"The elasticity of the polymers A, B and C showed a certain difference between both tests, and the polymer D showed a constant elasticity. The polymer with greater elasticity is the B. The experiment could improve the table, noting the initial measurements of each polymer.",2,2
3,175,175,es_3N1FSUEFL7DWVSK12TROHAIIZG5D42,"The plastic polymer A is the most elastic because it suffered less deformation after it was subjected to lengthening.\nTo improve the design of the experiment, the initial length of the plastic samples and also the length should have been noted when they were with the weights. Additionally indicate whether the second test was carried out with the same samples or with different samples",2,2
4,258,258,es_3W92K5RLWWU0LSON7JASSOU323U5VV,"a) The only conclusion that can be made is that the polymer D has resistance to weights for five minutes.\nb) To have better results, there would be to stop the initial measurement of two polymers and a third test (P3).",2,2

6,94,94,es_3A0EX8ZRNA1JE201D4OP29YPULRBYU,The plastic is very elastic. That is why so many millimeters could be gained in the 5-minute experiment at a time.\nB. The plastic could be folded with itself. This may have helped make the plastic not so elastic.,2,0
7,115,115,es_3CP1TO84PVERO1QLJ9QHQJXSB8B256,"The polymer samples were probably not under the same weight during the tests, another factor could be room temperature, so the results were so diverse.",2,0
8,69,69,es_386PBUZZXHA5WMREIHCG6PF60NALJ6,The samples A and B are longer than the finn The sample C is shorter than the sample D has no change. The experiment may have more information about the time of the experiment.,2,0
9,276,276,es_3YDGXNSEO17KEXOALLG8VI4HTUW48Q,The most flexible plastic was type A because it gained more length at the end of the experiment. It would have been better to use some sort of apparatus that could apply twist to different types of plastic so that the researchers knew exactly how much force was applied to the plastic.,2,0
10,197,197,es_3PIWWX1FJLJZ1W3EFW03QA2EMKBJJ6,You could improve it with scale graphics or graphics with plastic types and corresponding data.,2,0
11,93,93,es_39ZSFO5CAA98FCE8RV4HXCBPA0RUJ2,Plasitics A and B increased their length in the second test. Plastic C does not increase its length. Plastic D did not change in the second test.\nIt would have been better to use different types of plastics and methods.,2,0

15,176,176,es_3NKQQ8O390IVCQEGHZI6UEGC349DUW,"The polymer D recovers its size after the test, in case it has been altered at the time of making it, if the size is not altered that polymer is the one that has the best resistance to deformation, the polymers A and B do not recover their size in case it is different from the beginning, they have less resistance to deformation.\nFor me it is necessary to know how much the polymers mediate at the beginning and during the experiment to draw better conclusions if I am not who does it and only read this information",2,1

The plastic samples B and C have the same elasticity, being smaller than the A and larger than the D sample. You can use a press to measure the elasticity of the samples.n You can place the samples at the same time and measure the time it takes them to stretch, and thus measure the stretch time.",2,1
