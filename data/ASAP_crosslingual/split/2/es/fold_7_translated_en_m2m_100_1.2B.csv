Type C recorded less length after test P2 compared to test P1, which could indicate a mistake in measurement.\nThe design could have improved if the student had taken the initial measurement of each type of plastic and the length that the plastic gained in percentage terms with respect to initial length. Another improvement in the design could be using different weights for the P1 and P2 tests.",2,2

4,264,264,es_3WT783CTPDU6BZZWHC605I66Y74CB9,The experiment shows that the length gained by the plastic is consistent and depends on the chosen polymer. Do the procedure more often to improve the reliability of the result.,2,2

In the C must be wrong, because not only did it not stretch, but it shrunk according to its data. In D, it was the same.  I think it’s wrong or it needs new lenses. The measurement of C is clearly wrong. You should do the entire experiment again and point out the results at the moment.",2,0

Plastics A and B are somewhat more elastic, because they stretched but did not return. Plastic C is the most elastic. The final length is shorter due to stretching and retreat. The student may have measured the length of the plastics while the weights were placed.",2,0

Its value is: F=m·g where g is the intensity of gravity, that is, the force that experiences the unit of mass. The mass always has the same value, while the weight depends on the value of g, which is not identical everywhere.",2,0
