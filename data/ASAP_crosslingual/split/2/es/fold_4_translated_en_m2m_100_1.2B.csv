1,150,150,es_3I02618YA2J41NH6M891U8X1C22PU1,I think it would have taken longer to measure the elasticity. I could have left the weights longer and I think the weight should be indicated and somehow proportional to the length.,2,2
2,18,18,es_32SCWG5HIJHJZCR5QQBYE2JLCFAP6Q,"My conclusion is that this experiment is not valid to know the elasticity of the samples, because after taking the weights, we do not know when that sample is withdrawn.\n- You can measure the samples with the weights put.\n- You can do other tests at different temperature.",2,2
3,143,143,es_3GNA64GUZGH8GKS6LKGIM1VVPMI5QU,Plastic D has a higher elasticity and is the only one that has been consistent in measurement (mm). Ways to Improve Experimentation 1. Measure the plastics before and after to see the % growth (elasticity) over the normal size. 2nd Use a larger sample and calculate averages.,2,2
4,294,294,es_3ZSY5X72NZOU0VDO3E1H0X5RW5IORA,"The polymers that presented greater length are more elastic and less resistant to deformation.\nTo improve the validity of the results, the student should have used all measurements with the same length and analyze the difference between the results. Since the lengths are different, it is difficult to assume the quality of the experiment.",2,2

6,194,194,es_3P529IW9K0YPRK5IZRLVRRNE1XHFLD,by A. The conclusion passed to the data is that plastics gain length every time the experiment was done with the exception of type C plastics that did not gain length and type D plastics remain the same. The student would have improved the design of the experiment if he had taken a video to validate the results.,2,0

10,266,266,es_3X0H8UUIT31E6JM39PSW71N9VMMWS4,Polymer is a notion whose etymological origin is in the Greek language and refers to something formed by various components. This is confirmed by its etymological origin. Polymers are macromolecules that are formed by the linking of other classes of molecules called monomers.,2,0

13,82,82,es_39JEC7537WELKDX2MTX06U0D0B2VC3,"A. The student has realized that the “D” plastic is more resistant than the others. by nb. The student should form a hypothesis so that the experiment has a clear foundation. Additionally, new pieces of plastic should be incorporated for the following tests. It should be more than two. Only two evidence lacks foundation.",2,0
14,204,204,es_3Q5C1WP23OEKZG8P05Q3L0NNB5Y51R,"and a. Of all plastics, only type D has gained the same length in the two tests. The student could group the plastics according to their composition to get more results",2,0
15,157,157,es_3JZQSN0I3SN95SRHO0OFEZI66IIGF0,"The most elastic plastic is plastic A. To improve the design of the experiment the student must have used a new piece of plastic (of the same type) for each time he repeated the attempts of each plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to ensure that the weights are hung within the same measurements for each test, for example, if the weight hangs within 1mm, and the others also hang within 1mm, to ensure that the strength of the weight is provided with the other tests.",2,1
16,108,108,es_3BEFOD78W86ZZMQEFMQR005C8H6M4C,"The plastic has gained more length. For a better result the student should use new plastics before making the second test with the same plastics.  Leaving the plastic hanging is not a good idea, because the plastic can return to its original shape.",2,1
17,214,214,es_3QFUFYSY90STTCYXTZME5AL3JLQF4C,"A. Based on the information provided the plastic C shrunk compared to the others plastic. and there was no difference in the plastic D. b. Two ways in which the student could improve the experiment: 1. I could mention the names of the types of plastics, 2. Prodria would be more specific in the amount of weight used in the experiment.",2,1
