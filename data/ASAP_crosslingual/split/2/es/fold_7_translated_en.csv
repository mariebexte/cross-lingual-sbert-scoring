6,6,es_30MVJZJNHOQAVKQ5TK9Q1GOBXY29JD,"A, the conclusion based on the student's data came out that the top performing plastic type is A.",2,0
7,7,es_30X31N5D653HZ6J08KW4PCQI19ISAY,"The mass of a body measures the amount of matter it contains, while the weight measures the force with which the planet attracts that body.nnThe weight of a body is the force with which the planet attracts it. Its value is: F=m-g where g is the intensity of gravity, i.e., the force experienced by the unit of mass. nnThe mass always has the same value, while the weight depends on the value of g, which is not identical everywhere.",2,0
29,29,es_33L7PJKHCIB4VI300MHG3QG9628T8L,I think there is a mistake with plastic C. Maybe the student can use a magnet and an electric current to release all of the weights at the same time.,2,0
49,49,es_35K3O9HUADQBLEVQI5YREWXUV7QEFG,a. P2 is better. \nb. Two ways in which the student could have improved is by raising C and raising D.,2,0
88,88,es_39N5ACM9HG06HVT3OXEAYCAN2SXP94,"The plastic that deforms the least is type A, followed by type C, type D and finally type B. The plastic that showed the most deformation was type B. The type C plastic recorded less length after the P2 test compared to the P1 test which could indicate a measurement error. The design could have been improved if the student had taken the initial measurement of each type of plastic and reported the length that the plastic gained in terms of percentage with respect to the initial length. Another improvement in the design could be to use different weights for tests P1 and P2.",2,2
97,97,es_3AAPLD8UCEUXOT4T3QBMG398F77HTB,"The plastic material is undoubtedly a very elastic polymer in which it alters at the moment of placing weight on it, taking the data of each test in the difference chart it could be noticed that there is little difference but the material D had a relevant way to remain the same length there was no alteration.nThe result would have varied with a little more weight so that the material would notice its resistance and length in each of the tests.",2,1
116,116,es_3CTOC39K3936H12CENB6NKX52WS7JP,"The student could have indicated how much weight he added to the plastics, and also how much the plastics measured before attaching the weight.",2,2
125,125,es_3E4GGUZ1TA4U6KBOQWUNS8GAZ6MK2W,"It is concluded that: Plastic A is more expandable, and plastic D is the least expandable. I believe that this experiment would be more complete if all the plastics were given the same weight at the same time, so that the level of elasticity of each plastic could be identified much better, and in a single test. Greetings!",2,0
126,126,es_3EA3QWIZ4K8XKOFD98T7GFANCHBTIW,"Do a second test, exactly like test P2, ending like the first test.",2,1
129,129,es_3EO896NRAY8TFZZJRQE7SGPNK47JTG,"a. Plastic type A is the most flexible. Interestingly, the plastic type C, reduced in size after the experiment. It is better to design the experiment with the plastic hanging from the ceiling, rather than hanging from the side of a table. You could also extend the time of the experiment (more than 5 minutes) or try the experiment several times and calculate the average of all the results.",2,1
146,146,es_3GU1KF0O4KEP5O80MHS6PI5DSSOPB4,a. Plastic B is the most elastic of all plastics. The student could have taken more samples to draw an average and could have left the plastics longer.,2,3
152,152,es_3IJXV6UZ1ZWK492L5JOCG095JOFRIX,"In plastic A the plastic was stretched 2 mm. In B, the plastic was stretched by 1 mm.  In C it must be wrong, because not only did it not stretch, but it shrunk according to your data. On D, it stayed the same.  My guess is that he is either wrong or needs new lenses. The measurement of C is clearly wrong. You should redo the whole experiment and write down the results on the spot.",2,0
161,161,es_3KB8R4ZV1GKJSBF1JY2JV9RLPQKGBM,I think it should be improved with an afddfd bar graph.,2,0
168,168,es_3LQ8PUHQFN57FFOI9ECI2W7Z6U0HID,a)Plastic A is the least elastic.nb1)Prepare the weights glued to the plastic before placing themnb2)Know the date of manufacture of the plastics.,2,2
177,177,es_3NPFYT4IZEHQ5EI2OUU1K6ID8Y4XGI,"a. The conclusion of the experiment is that the polymer A and B were more elastic than C and D. Choosing another type of materials to replace polymer C and D, and obtain better results.",2,0

245,245,es_3UN61F00HY28SL76YZ5IRR50FNZR5K,"a. Based on the student's data, it can be concluded that the results of the first test did not change much in the second test. The first 3 plastics differed between one and two millimeters, but the third type of plastic made no difference. \nb. The student should include the weight of the coins and how many coins were included.",2,1
264,264,es_3WT783CTPDU6BZZWHC605I66Y74CB9,a. The experiment shows that the length gained by the plastic is consistent.and depends on the polymer chosen.nb. Do the procedure more times to improve the reliability of the result.,2,2
296,296,es_3ZWFC4W1UWK0UI0V4BIRD3WD5OARFF,"a. Based on the student's data, Plastic D is the least elastic. It did not stretch or spring back. Plastic A and B are somewhat more elastic, because they stretched but did not come back. Plastic C is the most elastic. The final length is shorter because of stretching and recoil. The student could have measured the length of the plastics as the weights were placed.",2,0
