25,25,es_33F859I568QXS7AC34K1G93M3K3BH9,"a) After the process P1, the plastics have been stretched enough, in relation to the weight added. In P2 as the plastics have already been stretched with the weight used in P1, the length gained is not very large, as can be observed in A and B.\In the case of C presents a loss of length which would indicate that it is a plastic with specific properties, (it is closer to the rubber). In the case of D there is no gain, it is a very moldable plastic.",2,0

61,61,es_37QW5D2ZRIZ3GIQLBMCQTLKNAK98SY,"a) As the elasticity is being tested, the polymer that proved to be more elastic is B, then D, C and finally A, from greater to lesser elasticity nnb) In order to improve the experiment is to make a third reproduction to get a more accurate standard deviation and know what is the variation of the reproduction of the experiment.",2,2

100,100,es_3AUQQEL7U761QL2MAD4GBTYCNLM0VQ,"According to the results, plastic sample A had greater elasticity. To improve the experiment, the ambient temperature should be taken into account, since the material is sensitive to heat and may affect the results.",2,1
109,109,es_3BEFOD78W86ZZMQEFMQR005C8HNM4T,"In principle, it does not indicate how much time passed between P1 and P2. Therefore, we do not really know if, if more time passed, each plastic would have returned to its natural state. On the other hand, we do not know well the measurements with which each plastic started. It would have been more useful to add the initial measurements, the measurements after 5 minutes, the measurement after 1 hour, and finally the difference (or how much it has gained in mm) after the 5 minutes and after the hour.",2,2
111,111,es_3C8HJ7UOP97F2JE30FGHUWIL9CMZME,"Based on the results, Plastic D has the most constant elasticity which means it is reliable. The student has to state the type of plastic and also has to state the conditions of the place where the experiment was performed. It should be in a temperature controlled environment.",2,2
113,113,es_3CN4LGXD5Z1ZT3FSYPE2UVSJHT8Y46,"The results of test C do not make sense. At most the plastic should retain its original length when a weight is applied to one end, but never shrink. To improve the design of the experiment, the student should have included a sketch of the experiment. In addition, he should have detailed the dimensions of the plastic to be used in the experiment.",2,1

203,203,es_3PZDLQMM0VYCNMZ0YJDP4P32US72CL,a. The student had a brilliant idea in doing that experiment on the polymers as he had a great result which I see is remarkable. The student would have chosen a plastic with longer length to have high results and big difference.,2,0

249,249,es_3VA45EW49P067QE75KM2U6NEZ7TO1Q,"The results explain the final elongation of the polymer, but not its elastic elongation (capacity to return to its original shape). It would be interesting to know the value of the weight attached to the clamps to establish the weight-elongation relationship. They could have measured the resistance of the material, applying the formula Force divided by area",2,2
254,254,es_3VNXK88KKEVJMFQZA9N944Z5WXXV90,"a. it follows from the experiment that sample B is the one that stretches the most, while sample A is the one that stretches the least. All samples gain length.nnb. the student can improve the validity of the measurements by making more attempts and averaging the values obtained for each sample. He could also vary the weights used to see the relationship between the weight and the length of the sample.",2,3
