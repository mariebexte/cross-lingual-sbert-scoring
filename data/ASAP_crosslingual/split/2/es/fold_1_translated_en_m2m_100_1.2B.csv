Two ways to improve the experiment are 1. include the original measurement of each sample and 2. include the amount of hanging weight of each sample.,2,3

Except for material D that stretches constantly.\nb) First, it could have carried out a greater number of tests for each material, so that the results were more conclusive.

Do the same test, but now taking into account the weight to which you submit the samples: e.g. perform the test with 0.5kg, 1kg and 1.5kg. Do the same test, now subjecting the plastic samples to longer stretching time and note the results for 10, 15 and 20 minutes.",2,2
