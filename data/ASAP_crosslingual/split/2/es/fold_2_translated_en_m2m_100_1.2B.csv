However, what should be measured is the relative increase in length, that is, the ratio between what was stretched and the original length. Because at no time is said that all the polymers used have had the same initial length. Nor is it said what happens after taking the weights, i.e. whether the sample returns to its original length or if it is stretched. We do not know whether the second experiment was done after the polymers returned to their original shape or not. If weights are excessive, the polymers can permanently deform, and we would no longer be measuring elasticity, which has to do with the material's ability to return to its original shape after stretching it.\nIn my opinion, four samples of equal size should be used, not only in length, but also in diameter, because the total volume should affect stretching. I would then gradually increase the weights, always checking that the polymers can return to their original shape after removing them, to make sure they have not deformed by an excessive load. The experiment would be limited by the maximum weight that could bear the less elastic polymer, comparing the lengths of all with this weight. Or you could also find the most elastic one after removing the other three by permanent deformation by increasing the weights.",2,3

Plastic type B is better than type A, because it has only increased 1mm, but the best of the four is type C, as it recovers the size of P1 and even decreases by 1mm, followed by type D, which remains equal between P1 and P2.

16,160,160,es_3K4J6M3CXG6E91A9DK2N0Y7F4DYGAX,"and a. It is concluded that the structure of plastic C develops a resistance to tension as in the second measurement it contracts instead of continuing to stretch. Plastic D remains stable in tension because in both measurements the gain in length is equal. Plastics A and B are less resistant to tension because at each test they have been lengthened a little. The student may have also taken the length of the plastic samples without taking the weights and comparing the length with the original length. The rest of these lengths constitute the true elasticity of the plastic. The second way to improve the experiment is to do more than two measurements (P3, P4 tests, etc.). This makes it possible to make a graphical representation of the length compared against the tension by the weight applied and would allow to establish the permanent deformation of each plastic in relation to the weight.",2,1
