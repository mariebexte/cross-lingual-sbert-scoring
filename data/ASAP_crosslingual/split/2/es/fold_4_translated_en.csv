18,18,es_32SCWG5HIJHJZCR5QQBYE2JLCFAP6Q,"My conclusion is that this experiment is not valid to know the elasticity of the samples, because after removing the weights, we don't know when that sample retracts. You can measure the samples with the weights on.",2,2

52,52,es_369J354OFFNDMZY6N7LBKT5TE87G64,We can use the strain gauge instead of using weights on the clamps. We can also use physical force by measuring a certain distance (mm) and calculating the time.,2,0
82,82,es_39JEC7537WELKDX2MTX06U0D0B2VC3,"A. The student has noticed that plastic ""D"" is stronger than the others. nB. The student should form a hypothesis so that the experiment has a clear foundation. In addition, new pieces of plastic should be incorporated for the next tests. There should be more than two. Only two trials lack a foundation.",2,0
91,91,es_39RP059MEJ6JKLBNU10E8EBIPYCMBS,"a. Since the results of P1 and P2 were not exactly the same, it appears that some factor of the experiment was not properly measured or reported for this experiment. 1) Include the exact length of the plastic at the time of the start. 2) Include the air temperature during the experiment.",2,3
108,108,es_3BEFOD78W86ZZMQEFMQR005C8H6M4C,"Plastic A has gained more length. For a better result the student should use new plastics instead of doing the second test with the same plastics.  Leaving the plastics hanging is not a good idea, because the plastic may return to its original shape.",2,1
128,128,es_3EJJQNKU9TIK8ER1Z16RGO8QJC3RH9,b. sample (D) will be the best due to the fact that the premiere and the second test yielded the same result,2,0
143,143,es_3GNA64GUZGH8GKS6LKGIM1VVPMI5QU,"Plastic D has a higher elasticity and is the only one that has been consistent in measurement (mm). Ways to improve the experiment, 1. Measure the plastics before and after to see the % growth (elasticity) over the normal size. 2. Use a larger sample and calculate averages of them.",2,2
150,150,es_3I02618YA2J41NH6M891U8X1C22PU1,a. I think to measure the elasticity would have required more time. I could have left the weights longer and I think the weight should be indicated and be somehow proportional perhaps to the length.,2,2
157,157,es_3JZQSN0I3SN95SRHO0OFEZI66IIGF0,"The plastic with the highest elasticity is plastic A. To improve the design of the experiment the student should have used a new piece of plastic (of the same type) for each time he repeated the trials for each plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to ensure that the weights are hung within the same measurements for each trial, i.e., if the weight hangs within 1mm, and the others hang within 1mm, to ensure that the weight strength is in proportion to the other trials.",2,1
194,194,es_3P529IW9K0YPRK5IZRLVRRNE1XHFLD,A. The conclusion drawn from the data is that the plastics gained length each time the experiment was done with the exception of plastic type C which did not gain length and plastic type D which remained the same. The student could have improved the experimental design if he had taken a video to validate the results.,2,0
204,204,es_3Q5C1WP23OEKZG8P05Q3L0NNB5Y51R,a. Of all the plastics only type D has gained the same length in the two tests. The student could group the plastics according to their compositions to get more results.,2,0
214,214,es_3QFUFYSY90STTCYXTZME5AL3JLQF4C,"a. Based on the information provided, plastic C shrunk compared to the other plastics and there was no difference in plastic D. b. Two ways the student could improve the experiment: 1. They could mention the names of the types of plastics, 2. They could be more specific in the amount of weight used in the experiment.",2,1

This is certified by its etymological origin. ... It can be said that polymers are macromolecules that are formed by linking other types of molecules called monomers.,2,0
