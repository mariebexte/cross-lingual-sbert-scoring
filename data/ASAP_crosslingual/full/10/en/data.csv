289,en_cw_000972,black :: according to the experiment is the color black,10,0
290,en_cw_000973,light_gray :: A shelter for the dog should have adequate insulation to protect the animal from both soil moisture and extreme temperatures.,10,0
291,en_cw_000974,"white :: The darker colors provide too hot temperature in a doghouse on a sunny summer day. The white color ensures minimal changes in temperature, so it's the most convenient.",10,1
292,en_cw_000975,white :: The darker color the higher temperature. I chose White color for dog house so the dog wont be too hot on summer.,10,1
293,en_cw_000976,"white :: In this experiment it shows that the three colors black, dark gray and light gray lid absorbs more light from bulb and increased the average air temperature in jar from 24 to 53 degrees .but white color absorb less light and the resultant air temperature remains the same as in trial 1 that is 42 so white color is more suitable for buildings.",10,2
294,en_cw_000977,"black :: I chose the color black, because it is the color that could be more damaging to the doghouse inside, since the dark colors absorb more radiation, while the clear ones reflect it. Therefore, the heat would be suffocating and much more harmful.",10,1
295,en_cw_000978,"white :: The least heating showed white color, other colors led to more heating.",10,1
296,en_cw_000979,"white :: Lights colors tends to reflect light, wich has energy that could heat a surface. Then, when light hits surfaces with light colors, these surfaces tend to absorb less heat than dark surfaces.",10,0
297,en_cw_000980,black :: The hypothesis is right. The black is warmer beacuse darker colors absorb more energy. More dark more energy,10,0
298,en_cw_000981,white :: use the white color with which there is less temperature in the air since they absorb less energy,10,1
299,en_cw_000982,"black :: the dark colors capture the color better, as we see in the experimebto the black one was the one that more heated",10,0
300,en_cw_000983,white :: red,10,0
301,en_cw_000984,white :: The inside will be cooler at the same exterior temperature.,10,1
302,en_cw_000985,white :: ambient temperature,10,0
303,en_cw_000986,black :: because the color black absorbs the temperature faster than other colors,10,0
304,en_cw_000987,black :: Energy is more,10,0
305,en_cw_000988,white :: it flexchuate with colouor as for white colour first it increase then there is a small chang in air temprature,10,0
