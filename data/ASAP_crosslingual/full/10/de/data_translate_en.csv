293,de_000896,White :: The color white reflects the light and thus less light energy is converted into heat.,10,1

295,de_000898,"White :: As the experiment shows, the color of a canning jar lid has an influence on the heating of the air inside the jar when irradiated directly with a lamp: the darker the lid, the more the air inside heats up. The tendency of this observation can probably be transferred to a doghouse, the roof of the doghouse and direct sunlight. Accordingly, the interior of a doghouse with a black roof would heat up significantly more than that of a doghouse with a white roof when the sun shines on it.",10,1
296,de_000899,"White :: Hypothesis confirmed: The darker the color, the more likely to retain heat. Whereby glass is not equal to wood. Since cells denature above 40°, I would not risk a hot dog.",10,1
297,de_000900,"White :: The darker the paint color of the dog house, the hotter it will be inside when the sun shines. Assuming that we want to keep our dog from overheating in the summer, we should paint the kennel as light as possible. However, if the goal is to keep the kennel as warm as possible (for winter temperatures), it would probably be better to paint the kennel black. In summer, the dog would not necessarily have to lie around in the hut, but lie down in the shade of the hut outside.",10,1
298,de_000901,White :: The paint color white would not heat up the dog house too much. So the dog could also visit it as a shady place.,10,1
