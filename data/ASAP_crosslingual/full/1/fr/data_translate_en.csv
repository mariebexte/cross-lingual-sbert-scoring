As the vinegar reacts with the marble chips, its low pH is raised to a higher number and less acidic. As a result of the chemical reaction, bubbles or foam are formed. 2.  Vinegar, an acid, dissolves pieces of a material called calcium carbonate in the limestone. This releases carbon dioxide, a gas that rises to the surface as a stream of bubbles. Rocks that do not contain calcium carbonate will not fizz. 3.Once the vinegar and milk were mixed, the reaction occurred and the protein was denatured. ...
