10,fr_020011,"Plastics and rubber are made of polymers consisting of smaller units called monomers, which bond (polymerize) into long chains. At present, the vast majority of monomers are produced from petroleum (crude oil/mineral oil) and are therefore non-renewable. Monomers can also be made from biomass, but usually at a higher cost. Apart from monomers, various additives are added to the manufacturing process of plastics and rubber. Additives are chemicals that are necessary for the polymerization process itself, or give the final product its desired specific properties, e.g. plasticizers, flame retardants, thermal and UV stabilizers, biocides, pigments, thinners, etc. Polymers are large in size, which means that they do not penetrate biological membranes and are not particularly reactive and therefore are not considered toxic. On the contrary, unreacted monomers, solvents, additives or degradation products can leak and be exposed to both humans and the environment throughout the life cycle of a product. Many common additives are classified as hazardous according to the EU Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP)_1 . It is relatively unknown for the majority of these chemicals how they affect our health and the environment, but some phthalates, bisphenol A, certain brominated flame retardants and polyfluorinated chemicals, have been relatively well studied and are therefore the focus of this report. These chemicals have a negative impact on humans and the environment, and surveys have shown that a large proportion of the population is constantly exposed to them. When chemicals are released from products or building materials in a home, the dust functions as a chemical sink that reflects any chemicals that may be exposed to the home. The polluted dust will be inhaled or eaten, as it ends up on food, accumulates in the mucous membranes of the mouth, or when children put dusty fingers and objects in their mouths.",2,0

63,fr_020064,"Construction and demolition waste (CDW), including valuable materials such as plastics, has a remarkable influence on the waste sector. For plastics to be reused, they must be identified and separated based on their polymer composition. In this study, the identification of these materials was performed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which identified the material based on their physicochemical properties. The advantages of the NIR method are low environmental impact and rapid measurement (within seconds) in the _1600-2400 nm spectral range without special sample preparation. Limitations include its inability to analyze dark materials. The identified polymers were used as a component for the wood-polymer composite (WPC), which consists of a polymer matrix, low-cost fillers and additives. The components were first composed of an agglomeration apparatus, followed by extrusion production. In the agglomeration process, the objective was to compound all materials to produce uniformly distributed and granulated materials in pellet form. During the agglomeration process, the polymer (matrix) was melted and the fillers and other additives were then mixed into the molten polymer, being ready for the extrusion process. In the extrusion method, heat and shear forces were applied to a material inside the barrel of a rotating twin-screw type conical extruder, which reduces the risk of burning the materials and reduces the shear mixing. The heated and sheared mixture was then passed through a die to form the product into the desired shape. The protocol described above proved the potential for reuse of CDW materials. The functional properties should be verified according to standard tests, such as flexural, tensile and impact strength tests for the material.  I",2,0

Elasticity is therefore a physical property, but in the context of a material that may need to support a weight and its shape may deform when carrying that weight, we consider its elasticity to be a mechanical property. b) The material contains long-chain molecules that are mostly randomly dispersed. Stretching causes the molecules to align, and the material becomes stronger.

103,fr_020104,"There are a number of ways to improve the validity of an experiment, including controlling more variables, improving the measurement technique, increasing randomization to reduce sample bias, blinding the experiment, and adding control or placebo groups.   Controlling more variables is about making sure that as few things as possible change during the experiment.  An ideal experiment is one where one thing is changed and one outcome is examined.  Everything else should stay the same.  So, for example, if you wanted to know how fast balls of different masses would roll down a particular hill, you would change the mass of the ball and keep everything else the same.  You would keep the material of the ball, the point of release, the place of measurement, a method, the humidity of the air, the height above sea level, and anything else you can think of the same.  The more you keep the same, the more likely it is that your result will be valid.   The measurement technique can also be improved.  Maybe instead of measuring something by hand, you could use a computer and an electronic sensor.  Or maybe instead of having one person measure the results, you could have several people take measurements and compare their responses.   Increasing randomization is one way to reduce a particular validity problem: sample bias.  This is when the samples being studied are not a representative sample of the population.  For example, let's say your tests for the effect of a drug and your trials contain mostly white men in their _20s and 30s.  This would not be a good sample because of the lack of range, age and gender. Or maybe you are testing weight loss drugs on people who are already at a healthy weight.

Based on the first and second experiments, it can apparently be inferred that the longer the time spent stretching the polymer plastic samples, the more they stretch because the weight on the clamp tends to intensify the stretching.  B. Therefore, if a third experiment were conducted on the same plastic samples, there would likely be an increase in stretching.However, it is recommended that students adopt different types of plastic samples and apply the same weight on them as in this experiment to see if the weight added to the clamp would have the same, similar, or different effects on the plastic samples.And they should also note the time to see how long it may take for a particular sample to stretch than others",2,3
